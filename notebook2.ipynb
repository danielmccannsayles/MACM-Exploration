      "Correct: True\n",
      "Reasoning: In an equilateral triangle, the sum of perpendiculars from any point inside the triangle to the three sides is equal to the length of the triangle's altitude. This is a property of equilateral triangles that follows from symmetry and equal division of area by the internal perpendiculars. Given the problem statement, point P is inside triangle ABC, and the lengths of the altitudes from P to the sides are 8, 6, and 7, respectively. Therefore, the altitude h of the triangle should indeed be the sum of these altitudes: 21. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the step correctly uses this geometric property to compute the altitude of triangle ABC.\n",
      "Step #1============\n",
      "Correct: True\n",
      "Reasoning: The current step relates the altitude of the equilateral triangle to its side length using the correct formula for an equilateral triangle's altitude. For an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the altitude is indeed given by \\( h = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\). This formula correctly relates the side length to the altitude by using the Pythagorean theorem in the 30-60-90 right triangle that forms when an altitude is drawn in an equilateral triangle. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given the altitude \\( h = 21 \\), the equation \\( 21 = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\) is set up correctly to find the side length $s$ of triangle $ABC$. Therefore, the current step uses the right relationship and setup to further solve for the triangle’s side length, paving the way to calculate the area of the triangle.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Rearranging the Equation**:\n",
      "   - The given equation from the previous step is: \n",
      "     \\[ 21 = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\]\n",
      "   - Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction: \n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Solving for s**:\n",

      "   - Rationalizing the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \\( \\sqrt{3} \\): \n",
      "     \\[ s = \\frac{42 \\times \\sqrt{3}}{3} \\]\n",
