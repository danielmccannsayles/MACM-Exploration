Help me to analyze the conditions and the objective of a problem.
You should only provide one objective.
The conditions must be derived directly from the problem; deductions or calculations to establish these conditions are not allowed.
You don't need to provide me with a solution for the time being.

Example 1:
Question:
Louis earns a base monthly salary of $\$$1,200 with 5$\%$ commission on sales. For a month with $\$$25,000 in sales, what are Louis's total earnings?
Conditions:
1. Louis earns a base monthly salary of $1,200.
2. He also earns a commission of 5$\%$ on sales.
3. In a particular month, Louis makes $25,000 in sales.
Objective:
Calculate Louis's total earnings for the month, which includes both his base salary and the commission from the sales.

Example 2:
Question:
A line segment has one endpoint at $(6,8)$ and midpoint at $(1,1)$. What is the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint?
Conditions:
1. A line segment has one endpoint at (6,8).
2. The midpoint of this line segment is at (1,1).
Objective:
1. Find the coordinates of the other endpoint of the line segment.
2. Find the sum of these coordinates.

I have some known conditions:
1. The function in question is \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \).
And my objective is:
1. Determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function.
Please derive one most direct conditions with logical relationships based on the known conditions.
NOTE:
1. You are only allowed to use the known conditions to derive new conclusions.
2. You have to use code to perform the math calculation.

### assistant: 
To determine the number of vertical asymptotes for the function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \), we need to find the values of \( x \) which make the denominator equal to zero, since vertical asymptotes occur at values of \( x \) where the function goes to infinity, which occurs when the denominator approaches zero and the numerator is nonzero.

Thus, I need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \) to see how many vertical asymptotes exist. Let's solve the quadratic equation.
### assistant: 
The quadratic equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \) has two solutions: \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\). Therefore, the graph of the function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \) has two vertical asymptotes, located at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\).

2. The function has two vertical asymptotes.


And I want to 1. Determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function..
Help me to determine if the objective can be obtained based on the known conditions or the objective is already one of the current conditions.

### assistant: 
The objective, which is to determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function \(y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6}\), can be obtained by examining the known conditions. Condition 2 already states the function has two vertical asymptotes. Vertical asymptotes typically occur where the denominator of a rational function is equal to zero (assuming the numerator is not also zero at those points).

Given that condition 2 directly specifies the number of vertical asymptotes for the function, the objective has essentially been achieved and is already included in the conditions. It is not necessary to perform further analysis to ascertain the number of vertical asymptotes. However, for the sake of completeness and verification, we can factor the denominator and find the values where it becomes zero to confirm the condition. Let's do this.
### assistant: 
The denominator of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) is zero for \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \), which confirms that the function does have two vertical asymptotes at these points. This supports condition 2 and provides the verification for the objective. Therefore, based on the known conditions, the objective to determine the number of vertical asymptotes has indeed been achieved.

Help me to come up with one solution targeting at our objective. 

Example 1:
Known conditions: 
1. f(3) = 5
2. for all x > 0, f(3x) = f(x) + 2
3. Because f(3x) = f(x) + 2, so f(9) = f(3) + 2
4. Because f(3x) = f(x) + 2, and f(3) = 5, so f(9) = 7
5. Because f(3x) = f(x) + 2, so f(27) = f(9) + 2
Objective:
find $f^{-1}(11)$
Solutions:
Step 1:
Use f(9) to find f(27)
Step 2:
Use f(27) to find f(81)
Step 3:
Repeat until find x that f(x) = 11

Example 2:
Known conditions: 
1. a + 1 / b = 22 / 7
2. b + 1 / c = 8
3. abc = 21
4. c = 1 / (8 - b)
5. a = (22 / 7) - (1 / b) 
Objective:
Calaculate c + 1 / a
Solutions:
Step 1:
Substitude a in abc = 21 by (22 / 7) - (1 / b) 
Step 2:
Substitude c in abc = 21 by 1 / (8 - b) 
Step 3:
Calculate b 
Step 4:
Calculate a and c
Step 5:
Calculate c + 1 / a

Real question:
Known conditions:
1. The function in question is \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \).
2. The function has two vertical asymptotes.


Objective:
1. Determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function.
Solutions:

### assistant: 
Given the function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \), we can find the vertical asymptotes by identifying the values of \( x \) that make the denominator equal to zero, because a vertical asymptote occurs at points where the function value tends to infinity.

Step 1: Find the roots of the denominator \( x^2+x-6 \) by solving the quadratic equation \( x^2+x-6=0 \).

Step 2: The roots of the quadratic equation will be the x-values where the vertical asymptotes occur.

Step 3: Confirm whether each root corresponds to a vertical asymptote by checking that the function goes to infinity as \( x \) approaches the root from the left and right sides.

Since we are asked to determine the number of vertical asymptotes, we will focus on steps 1 and 2 and confirm the roots of the denominator.

Let's start by finding the roots of the denominator.
### assistant: 
Solutions:
Step 1: Factor the denominator to find the roots. 
Step 2: The roots of the denominator are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).
Step 3: Since the function is undefined at these two points, they correspond to the vertical asymptotes.

Therefore, the given function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \) has two vertical asymptotes at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \), confirming the initial statement that the function has two vertical asymptotes.
