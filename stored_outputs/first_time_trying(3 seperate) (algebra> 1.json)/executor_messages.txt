assistant: Based on the conditions provided and following the steps outlined:

1. Identify the values at which the denominator equals zero:
   The denominator is \(x^2 + x - 6\). When this equals zero, the function will have vertical asymptotes.

2. Factor the denominator:
   To factor \(x^2 + x - 6 = 0\), we look for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to 1 (the coefficient of x). The two numbers that meet these conditions are 3 and -2.

   Therefore, \(x^2 + x - 6\) factors to \((x + 3)(x - 2)\).

3. Solve the factored equation for x:
   Set each factor equal to zero to find the values of x that cause the function to be undefined.

   \(x + 3 = 0\) yields \(x = -3\)
   \(x - 2 = 0\) yields \(x = 2\)

4. Conclude that vertical asymptotes exist at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\), since these values of x make the denominator zero and the function undefined.

The final objective: There are 2 vertical asymptotes for the graph of the given function at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\).

You answer:


assistant: Step 1:
The denominator of the function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \) has been factored as \( (x - 2)(x + 3) \).

Step 2:
The zeros of the denominator after factoring are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).

Step 3:
The vertical asymptotes of the function are located at the zeros of the denominator, so we have vertical asymptotes at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).

Step 4:
Confirming the number of vertical asymptotes matches the known condition: The number of vertical asymptotes, which is two, matches the known condition.

Your answer:
The function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \) has two vertical asymptotes at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). The factored form of the denominator is \( (x - 2)(x + 3) \), and these values correspond to the vertical asymptotes of the graph. This result is consistent with the known condition provided.
