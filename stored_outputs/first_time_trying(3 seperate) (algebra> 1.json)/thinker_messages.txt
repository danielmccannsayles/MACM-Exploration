Real question:
Question:
How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?


assistant: The quadratic equation \(x^2 + x - 6 = 0\) has two solutions: \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\).

Thus, there are two values of \(x\) at which the denominator of the given function \(y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6}\) is equal to zero. These are the locations of the vertical asymptotes of the graph of the function.

Therefore, the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function is 2.
assistant: To determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \), we must find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator equal to zero, as vertical asymptotes occur at values of \( x \) where the function approaches infinity (or negative infinity).

The denominator is a quadratic function given by \( x^2 + x - 6 \). We can find the values for \( x \) that make this expression equal to zero by solving the quadratic equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \).

We will use the quadratic formula to find the roots of this equation:
\[ x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}}{{2a}} \]
where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the coefficients of the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

In this case, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -6 \).

Let's perform the calculation to find the values of \( x \).

I have some known conditions:
1. The function given is \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \).
And my objective is:
1. Calculate the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function.
Please derive one most direct conditions with logical relationships based on the known conditions.
NOTE:
1. You are only allowed to use the known conditions to derive new conclusions.
2. You have to use code to perform the math calculation.


assistant: Based on Known condition 1 (the function given is \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \)), we can get: The number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function is 2.

Reason: Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function is equal to zero and the numerator is not equal to zero. By solving the equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \), which represents the denominator of the given function, we find that it has two solutions, \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). These solutions correspond to the values of \( x \) at which the function has vertical asymptotes. Hence, the graph of the function has two vertical asymptotes.

assistant: Solutions:
Step 1:
Identify the values at which the denominator equals zero.

Step 2:
Factor the denominator \(x^2 + x - 6\) to get \((x + 3)(x - 2)\).

Step 3:
Solve the factored equation for x, yielding \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\).

Step 4:
Conclude that vertical asymptotes exist at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\), since these values of x make the denominator zero and the function undefined.

Following these steps, we calculate that there are 2 vertical asymptotes for the graph of the given function at x = -3 and x = 2, which aligns with the known condition that there are 2 vertical asymptotes.
assistant: To solve this real question, we can find the vertical asymptotes of the given function by following these steps:

Step 1:
Determine the values of x for which the denominator of the function \(y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6}\) is equal to zero, because the vertical asymptotes occur at values of x that make the denominator zero and thus make the function undefined.

Step 2:
Factor the quadratic expression in the denominator, which is \(x^2 + x - 6\).

Step 3:
Set the factored expression equal to zero and solve for x to find the critical values.

Step 4:
Verify that for each found critical value, the limit of the function \(y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6}\) as x approaches the critical value is infinite, making the line x equal to that critical value a vertical asymptote.

Let's execute these steps in order. First, we factor the denominator and solve for x.
