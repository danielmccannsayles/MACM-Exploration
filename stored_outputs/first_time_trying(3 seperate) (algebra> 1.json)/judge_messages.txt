assistant: The statement is correct. By solving the equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \), which represents the denominator of the given function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \), we find that it has two solutions, \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). Since the numerator of the function, which is \( 2 \), does not equal zero when \( x = -3 \) or \( x = 2 \), these two values of \( x \) are indeed the points where the function has vertical asymptotes. Hence, the graph of the function has two vertical asymptotes.
user: 
I have some Known condtions:
1. The function given is \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \).
Help me to carefully verify if the statement:
Based on Known condition 1 (the function given is \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \)), we can get: The number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function is 2.

Reason: Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function is equal to zero and the numerator is not equal to zero. By solving the equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \), which represents the denominator of the given function, we find that it has two solutions, \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). These solutions correspond to the values of \( x \) at which the function has vertical asymptotes. Hence, the graph of the function has two vertical asymptotes. is correct.

assistant: The roots of the denominator \( x^2 + x - 6 \) are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). These roots correspond to the values of \( x \) where the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) has vertical asymptotes because at these points, the denominator is zero, causing the function to be undefined. Therefore, there are indeed 2 vertical asymptotes, confirming the information given in condition #2.
assistant: The objective is to calculate the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function, which is \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \).

This objective is already given in condition #2, which states that the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function is 2.

However, if we want to verify this information by calculation, we can analyze the function's denominator, \( x^2 + x - 6 \), to find its roots. Vertical asymptotes occur at values of \( x \) that cause the denominator to be zero, provided the numerator does not also become zero at those points.

Let's find the roots of the denominator to confirm the number of vertical asymptotes.

assistant: The statement is correct. By solving the equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \), I have found that the roots are indeed \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).
