Help me to analyze the conditions and the objective of a problem.
You should only provide one objective.
The conditions must be derived directly from the problem; deductions or calculations to establish these conditions are not allowed.
You don't need to provide me with a solution for the time being.

Example 1:
Question:
Louis earns a base monthly salary of $\$$1,200 with 5$\%$ commission on sales. For a month with $\$$25,000 in sales, what are Louis's total earnings?
Conditions:
1. Louis earns a base monthly salary of $1,200.
2. He also earns a commission of 5$\%$ on sales.
3. In a particular month, Louis makes $25,000 in sales.
Objective:
Calculate Louis's total earnings for the month, which includes both his base salary and the commission from the sales.

Example 2:
Question:
A line segment has one endpoint at $(6,8)$ and midpoint at $(1,1)$. What is the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint?

I have some known conditions:
1. The graph in question is of the function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$.
And my objective is:
1. Determine the number of vertical asymptotes for the graph of the given function.
Please derive one most direct conditions with logical relationships based on the known conditions.
NOTE:
1. You are only allowed to use the known conditions to derive new conclusions.
2. You have to use code to perform the math calculation.

### assistant: 
Based on the given function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$, we can find several conditions:

1. Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is equal to zero because the function will tend toward infinity or negative infinity at those values. This is represented by the condition $x^2 + x - 6 = 0$.
2. To find the specific values that cause the denominator to be zero, we solve the quadratic equation in the denominator.
3. By solving the equation, we will determine the number of distinct roots which correspond to the number of vertical asymptotes.

After performing the calculation, we found that the roots of the equation $x^2 + x - 6 = 0$ are $x = -3$ and $x = 2$. These are the points at which the graph of the function will have vertical asymptotes. The number of vertical asymptotes for the graph of the function is thus 2.
### Tool Usage
Input: 
```
from sympy import symbols, solve

# Define the variable and function
x = symbols('x')
function = 2 / (x**2 + x - 6)

# Find the roots of the denominator which will give the vertical asymptotes
denominator = x**2 + x - 6
vertical_asymptotes = solve(denominator, x)
number_of_asymptotes = len(vertical_asymptotes)
vertical_asymptotes, number_of_asymptotes

Help me to come up with one solution targeting at our objective. 

Example 1:
Known conditions: 
1. f(3) = 5
2. for all x > 0, f(3x) = f(x) + 2
3. Because f(3x) = f(x) + 2, so f(9) = f(3) + 2
4. Because f(3x) = f(x) + 2, and f(3) = 5, so f(9) = 7
5. Because f(3x) = f(x) + 2, so f(27) = f(9) + 2
Objective:
find $f^{-1}(11)$
Solutions:
Step 1:
Use f(9) to find f(27)
Step 2:
Use f(27) to find f(81)
Step 3:
Repeat until find x that f(x) = 11

5. a = (22 / 7) - (1 / b)

Real question:
Known conditions:
1. The graph in question is of the function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$.
2. The number of vertical asymptotes for the graph of the function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ is 2.

Objective:
1. Determine the number of vertical asymptotes for the graph of the given function.
Solutions:

### assistant: 
To determine the number of vertical asymptotes for the graph of the function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$, we need to identify the values of $x$ that cause the denominator to be zero since vertical asymptotes occur at the values of $x$ where the function is undefined.

Step 1:
Factor the denominator $x^2+x-6$.

Step 2:
Find the roots of the equation $x^2+x-6=0$.

Step 3:
The values of $x$ that are the roots of the equation will be the locations of the vertical asymptotes.

Step 4:
Ensure there are no cancellations with the numerator, which could remove the asymptotes. (In this case, the numerator is a constant, so no cancellations are possible.)

Let's proceed with these steps.
### assistant: 
Solutions:
The roots of the equation $x^2+x-6=0$ are $x=-3$ and $x=2$. These are the values at which the function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ is undefined and hence the locations of the vertical asymptotes. There are no cancellations with the numerator since it is a constant (2 in this case).

Therefore, the function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has 2 vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$, confirming the given condition that there are 2 vertical asymptotes.

### assistant: 
Based on the given information and steps:

Our objective is to determine the number of vertical asymptotes for the graph of the function \(y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}\).

Following the solutions provided:

1. We find the roots of the denominator \(x^2+x-6=0\) which are \(x=-3\) and \(x=2\).

2. These roots indicate where the function is undefined, and thus, the locations of the vertical asymptotes.

3. There are no factors in the numerator that cancel with the denominator, hence the vertical asymptotes are valid.

Therefore, the function \(y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}\) has 2 vertical asymptotes at \(x=-3\) and \(x=2\).

Final answer: The number of vertical asymptotes for the graph of the function \(y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}\) is 2.
