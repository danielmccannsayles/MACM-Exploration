## test
### user: 
Write a python program to calculate the first n fibonacci numbers. Check that it works by running it in the code interpreter, and print() out the final answer to make sure its actually correct.
### assistant: 
The program successfully calculated the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, which are `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]`.
### Tool Usage
Input: 
```
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        next_fib = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
        fib_sequence.append(next_fib)
    return fib_sequence[:n]

# Let's calculate the first 10 fibonacci numbers
fibonacci_numbers = fibonacci(10)
print(fibonacci_numbers)
```
 
Outputs: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
