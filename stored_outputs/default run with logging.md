Help me to analyze the conditions and the objective of a problem.
You should only provide one objective.
The conditions must be derived directly from the problem; deductions or calculations to establish these conditions are not allowed.
You don't need to provide me with a solution for the time being.

Example 1:
Question:
Louis earns a base monthly salary of $\$$1,200 with 5$\%$ commission on sales. For a month with $\$$25,000 in sales, what are Louis's total earnings?
Conditions:
1. Louis earns a base monthly salary of $1,200.
2. He also earns a commission of 5$\%$ on sales.
3. In a particular month, Louis makes $25,000 in sales.
Objective:
Calculate Louis's total earnings for the month, which includes both his base salary and the commission from the sales.

Example 2:
Question:
A line segment has one endpoint at $(6,8)$ and midpoint at $(1,1)$. What is the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint?
Conditions:
1. A line segment has one endpoint at (6,8).
2. The midpoint of this line segment is at (1,1).
Objective:
1. Find the coordinates of the other endpoint of the line segment.
2. Find the sum of these coordinates.

Real question:
Question:

### assistant: 
Conditions:

I have some known conditions:
1. We have a function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$.
2. We are considering vertical asymptotes of the graph of this function.
And my objective is:
1. Determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the function.
Please derive one most direct conditions with logical relationships based on the known conditions.
NOTE:
1. You are only allowed to use the known conditions to derive new conclusions.
2. You have to use code to perform the math calculation.

### assistant: 
To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which the denominator is equal to zero because a vertical asymptote occurs at any value of \( x \) that makes the function undefined (where the denominator is zero). 

The denominator is a quadratic expression \( x^2 + x - 6 \), and we can factor this to find the roots, which gives us the values of \( x \) for the vertical asymptotes.

So, using this logical reasoning based on the known conditions, we derive one most direct conclusion:

Direct conclusion:
"The number of vertical asymptotes of the function is equal to the number of distinct real roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \)".

Let's solve this quadratic equation using Python to find the roots.
### assistant: 
The quadratic equation \(x^2 + x - 6 = 0\) has two distinct real roots: \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\). Therefore, the function \(y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6}\) has two vertical asymptotes, at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\).
### Tool Usage
Input: 
```
# Import the sympy library to solve the quadratic equation
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define the variable
x = symbols('x')

# Define the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 6 = 0
equation = Eq(x**2 + x - 6, 0)

# Solve the quadratic equation for x
roots = solve(equation, x)

# The number of vertical asymptotes is the number of distinct real roots of the equation
num_asymptotes = len(roots)

Based on Known condition 1, which states we have a function \(y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}\), and Known condition 2, which considers the vertical asymptotes of the graph of this function, we can get: The function \(y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}\) has two vertical asymptotes.

Reason: Vertical asymptotes occur at the values of \( x \) that make the denominator of the function equal to zero. To find these values, the equation \(x^2 + x - 6 = 0\) must be solved. The roots of this quadratic equation are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \), which are the points at which the function is undefined and the graph has vertical asymptotes.

I have some known conditions:
1. The function is defined as \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \).

2. You have to use code to perform the math calculation.

### assistant: 
To determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \), we need to consider where the denominator equals zero, as vertical asymptotes occur at values of x for which the function is undefined (where the denominator is zero).

So, the most direct condition derived from the known condition:
1. Solve \( x^2+x-6=0 \) for x in the real number domain to find the x-values where the vertical asymptotes occur.

Let's solve this equation using Python to find the x-values where the function has vertical asymptotes.
### assistant: 
The equation \( x^2+x-6=0 \) has two real solutions: \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).

Thus, the derived condition is:
1. The function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \) has two vertical asymptotes, at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).
### Tool Usage

Based on Known condition 1 (The function is defined as \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \)), we can get: The function has two vertical asymptotes.
Reason: Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is equal to zero. Upon solving the denominator equation \( x^2+x-6=0 \), we find that it has two real solutions, \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).

### assistant: 
The limits of the function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \) as \( x \) approaches -3 from the right is \(-\infty\) and from the left is \(+\infty\). Similarly, as \( x \) approaches 2 from the right, the limit is \(+\infty\) and from the left is \(-\infty\). These results confirm that there are indeed vertical asymptotes as \( x \) approaches -3 and 2, because the function approaches infinity in magnitude with opposite signs from each side (indicating a discontinuity at these points).

### assistant: 
To find the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \), we need to find the values of \( x \) for which the denominator is equal to zero because vertical asymptotes occur at these values. The denominator is a quadratic equation given by \( x^2+x-6 \).

Therefore, we need to factor the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula to find its roots.

Let's solve for \( x \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the coefficients of the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). In our case, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -6 \).

Let's calculate the roots of the quadratic equation to determine the x-values where the vertical asymptotes occur.
### assistant: 
It seems there was an interruption in our connection. Let me try to calculate the roots of the quadratic equation again to find the vertical asymptotes.
### assistant: 
The roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + x - 6\) are \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\). These roots represent the x-values where the denominator of the function \(y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6}\) is equal to zero. Consequently, there are two vertical asymptotes for this function, located at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\).

Condition 2 explicitly states that there are two vertical asymptotes for the graph of the function.

In other words, the objective to calculate the number of vertical asymptotes is already met by the information given in the known conditions. Vertical asymptotes occur at the values of \(x\) that make the denominator of the function equal to zero, which are the roots of the quadratic equation in the denominator, \(x^2 + x - 6 = 0\). My previous confirmation that the roots are \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\) supports the statement of there being two vertical asymptotes, and these roots align with the known conditions.

I need you to find the final objective based on some steps.
Our objective is:
1. Determine the number of vertical asymptotes for the graph of the given function.
We have:
1. The graph in question is of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \).
2. The function has two vertical asymptotes. 

The steps that you should follow:
Step 1:
Factor the denominator of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) to find its roots.

Step 2:
Identify the x-values for which the denominator is zero, because these x-values will be the vertical asymptotes.

Step 3:
Verify the number of distinct roots obtained from Step 1; this will be the number of vertical asymptotes.

Shall we proceed to solve this problem accordingly?
You answer:

### assistant: 
Step 1:
The factored form of the denominator \( x^2 + x - 6 \) is \( (x - 2)(x + 3) \).

Step 2:
The x-values for which the denominator is zero, and hence the function has vertical asymptotes, are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -3 \).

Step 3:
The number of distinct roots of the factored denominator is 2.

Your answer:
The function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) has 2 vertical asymptotes at \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -3 \).
