### user: 
You are a thinker. I need you to help me think about some problems. You need to provide me the answer based on the format of the example. 
### user: 

I have some known conditions:
1. The function to analyze is $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$.
And my objective is:
1. Determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function.
Please derive one most direct conditions with logical relationships based on the known conditions.
NOTE:
1. You are only allowed to use the known conditions to derive new conclusions.
2. You have to use code to perform the math calculation.

### assistant: 
To determine the number of vertical asymptotes for the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \), we need to look for values of \( x \) that make the denominator \( x^2 + x - 6 \) equal to zero, since vertical asymptotes occur at the points where the function is undefined (the denominator cannot be zero in a fraction).

Direct Condition Derived:
- The number of unique real solutions to the equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \) will equal the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of \( y \).

Now, let’s solve the equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \) to find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero. This is a quadratic equation, and we will use the quadratic formula to find its roots:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

For the equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \), \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -6 \).

Let's perform the calculation to determine the roots of this equation.
### assistant: 
The quadratic equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \) has two unique real solutions: \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).

Therefore, based upon the direct condition derived earlier:

- Since we have two unique real solutions, there are two vertical asymptotes for the graph of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).
### Tool Usage
Input: 
```
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables

Help me to determine if the objective can be obtained based on the known conditions or the objective is already one of the current conditions.

### assistant: 
The number of vertical asymptotes for the graph of a rational function corresponds to the number of distinct real zeros of the denominator, provided that those zeros are not also zeros of the numerator. 

For the given function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \), the denominator is \( x^2+x-6 \). To find the vertical asymptotes, you need to set the denominator equal to zero and solve for x:

\( x^2+x-6 = 0 \)

You can factor this quadratic equation as follows:

\( (x+3)(x-2) = 0 \).

This implies that the function has zeros (and thus potential vertical asymptotes) at \( x=-3 \) and \( x=2 \), since these are the points where the function is undefined.

Given the second condition, which states that there are indeed two vertical asymptotes for the graph of the function, it can be concluded that the vertices are exactly at the points where \( x=-3 \) and \( x=2 \), assuming the numerator does not cancel out these zeros (which in this case, it does not, as the numerator is simply \( 2 \)).

So the objective of determining the number of vertical asymptotes can be obtained based on known conditions, and in fact, the objective is already one of the current conditions. Hence, the statement itself, which is a part of the known conditions, provides the judgment you are looking to make: there are two vertical asymptotes for the graph of the function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \).

I have some Known condtions:
1. The graph in question is of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \).
Help me to carefully verify if the statement:
Based on Known condition 1. \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \), we can get: The graph of the function has two vertical asymptotes at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).

Reason: Vertical asymptotes occur at the values of \( x \) that cause the denominator of a rational function to be zero, as long as those points are not also zeros of the numerator. In this case, solving the denominator \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \) gives us the \( x \)-coordinates where the function is undefined and the graph has vertical asymptotes. is correct.
You have to use code to verify the math calculation.

### assistant: 
To verify the statement, we need to confirm two points:

1. The values \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \) make the denominator \( x^2 + x - 6 \) of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) equal to zero, which we've already established.
2. These values, \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \), are not also zeros of the numerator, which is \( 2 \) in this case. Since the numerator is a constant and not equal to zero, these x-values do not make the entire fraction zero. Thus, they are indeed the locations of vertical asymptotes.

Let's reconfirm the calculation for the denominator and check that the numerator does not go to zero for these values.
### assistant: 
The numerator of the function, which is \( 2 \), does not equal zero for the x-values \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).

\[
\boxed{Judgment} \quad \text{The statement is correct. The graph of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) has two vertical asymptotes at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \)}.

Reason: The calculated values of \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \) from the denominator lead to division by zero, and these values do not coincide with zeros of the constant numerator, affirming the presence of vertical asymptotes at these points.

### user: 
Take on the given role and answer the users question step by step
### user: 
You're a judge. I need you to make judgments on some statements. 
### user: 

I have some Known condtions:
1. The graph in question is of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \).
Help me to carefully verify if the statement:
Based on Known condition 1. \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \), we can get: The graph of the function has two vertical asymptotes at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).

Reason: Vertical asymptotes occur at the values of \( x \) that cause the denominator of a rational function to be zero, as long as those points are not also zeros of the numerator. In this case, solving the denominator \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \) gives us the \( x \)-coordinates where the function is undefined and the graph has vertical asymptotes. is correct.
You have to use code to verify the math calculation.

### assistant: 
To verify the statement, we need to confirm two points:

1. The values \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \) make the denominator \( x^2 + x - 6 \) of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) equal to zero, which we've already established.
2. These values, \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \), are not also zeros of the numerator, which is \( 2 \) in this case. Since the numerator is a constant and not equal to zero, these x-values do not make the entire fraction zero. Thus, they are indeed the locations of vertical asymptotes.

Let's reconfirm the calculation for the denominator and check that the numerator does not go to zero for these values.
### assistant: 
The numerator of the function, which is \( 2 \), does not equal zero for the x-values \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).

\[
\boxed{Judgment} \quad \text{The statement is correct. The graph of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) has two vertical asymptotes at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \)}.

Reason: The calculated values of \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \) from the denominator lead to division by zero, and these values do not coincide with zeros of the constant numerator, affirming the presence of vertical asymptotes at these points.

I have some known conditions:
1. The graph in question is of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \).
2. The graph of the function has two vertical asymptotes at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).


And I want to 1. Determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the function..
Help me to determine if the objective can be obtained based on the known conditions or the objective is already one of the current conditions.

### assistant: 
Based on the known conditions, the objective of determining the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) can be achieved and, in fact, has already been stated as part of the second condition.

To confirm this, we can analyze the function. Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is equal to zero because the function approaches infinity or negative infinity at those points. Let's factor the denominator:

\( x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2) \)

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the roots:
\( x + 3 = 0 \) which gives \( x = -3 \)
\( x - 2 = 0 \) which gives \( x = 2 \)

These are the values at which the function is undefined, and hence, they are the x-coordinates of the vertical asymptotes. There are indeed two vertical asymptotes for the function, and they occur at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \), as stated in condition 2.

Therefore, the objective has been met by the information given in condition 2.

### assistant: 
To determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \), we need to find the values of x for which the denominator is zero, because vertical asymptotes occur at values of x where the function approaches infinity.

Therefore, the most direct condition to derive is to find the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + x - 6 = 0\), which will give us the x-values where the function has vertical asymptotes.

We will now use code to solve for the roots of this equation.
### assistant: 
The roots of the equation \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \) are x = -3 and x = 2.

These are the values of x for which the denominator of the function \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \) becomes zero, and therefore are the points where the function has vertical asymptotes.

### assistant: 
The objective "Determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function" can be obtained based on the known conditions, and in fact, the objective has already been stated in one of the current conditions.

The given function is \( y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \). We can determine the vertical asymptotes by finding the values of \( x \) for which the denominator equals zero, since the function will be undefined at these points, and vertical asymptotes occur at these undefined points.

To find the vertical asymptotes, we solve the quadratic equation in the denominator:

\[ x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \]

Factoring the quadratic, we get:

\[ (x + 3)(x - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the roots:

\[ x = -3 \quad \text{and} \quad x = 2 \]

These are the values where the function is undefined, and hence these are the values where the vertical asymptotes occur.

As a judge, based on the given function, I can affirm that there are indeed two vertical asymptotes for the graph of the function, located at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). Therefore, the second known condition correctly states the number of vertical asymptotes.

Step 4:
Find the roots of the equation by setting each factor equal to zero.

Example 1:
Known conditions: 
1. f(3) = 5
2. for all x > 0, f(3x) = f(x) + 2
3. Because f(3x) = f(x) + 2, so f(9) = f(3) + 2
4. Because f(3x) = f(x) + 2, and f(3) = 5, so f(9) = 7
5. Because f(3x) = f(x) + 2, so f(27) = f(9) + 2
Objective:
find $f^{-1}(11)$
Solutions:
Step 1:
Use f(9) to find f(27)
Step 2:
Use f(27) to find f(81)
Step 3:
Repeat until find x that f(x) = 11

2. b + 1 / c = 8
3. abc = 21
4. c = 1 / (8 - b)
5. a = (22 / 7) - (1 / b)

Calaculate c + 1 / a
Solutions:
Step 1:
Substitude a in abc = 21 by (22 / 7) - (1 / b)

Substitude c in abc = 21 by 1 / (8 - b)

Step 1:
Factor the denominator of \(y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}\) to find potential vertical asymptotes.

Ensure that any solutions found are valid by checking that they are not cancelled by any factor in the numerator (though in this case, there is no such factor).

Step 4:
Conclude the number of vertical asymptotes from the number of unique valid solutions found in Step 2.

Based on Known condition 1, that the function in question is \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \), we can get: The function has vertical asymptotes at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\).
Reason: Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a fraction is zero (provided the numerator is not zero at the same point, which would indicate a hole rather than an asymptote). By factoring the denominator \(x^2 + x - 6\), we find that it is zero at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\). Therefore, these are the x-values where the function has vertical asymptotes.

### user: 

I have some Known condtions:
1. The function in question is \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \).
Help me to carefully verify if the statement:
Based on Known condition 1, that the function in question is \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \), we can get: The function has vertical asymptotes at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\).
Reason: Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a fraction is zero (provided the numerator is not zero at the same point, which would indicate a hole rather than an asymptote). By factoring the denominator \(x^2 + x - 6\), we find that it is zero at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\). Therefore, these are the x-values where the function has vertical asymptotes. is correct.
You have to use code to verify the math calculation.

### assistant: 
I made an error by trying to use the `subs` method on an integer, which does not have this method. Since the numerator is a constant (2 in this case), it does not change its value based on x and is definitely not zero. Nonetheless, let me correct the code to avoid confusion and reaffirm the conclusion properly.
### assistant: 
The statement is correct. The function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) does indeed have vertical asymptotes at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\). The numerator is a constant (2) and is not zero at these points. Since vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, the given statement that the function has vertical asymptotes at these points is verified to be true.
### Tool Usage
Input: 
```
# Since the numerator is a constant (2), it cannot be zero. We just need to confirm that it's not zero.
numerator_is_not_zero = numerator != 0

# The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero
# Check if the vertical asymptotes calculated before are valid
vertical_asymptotes_valid = all(value != 0 for value in factored_denominator)

statement_verification = numerator_is_not_zero and vertical_asymptotes_valid
statement_verification
```
 
Outputs: 
Input: 
```
# Verify the statement concerning vertical asymptotes by checking if numerator is not zero at the points where denominator is zero

# Define the numerator of the function
numerator = 2

# Evaluate the numerator at the potential asymptotes x = -3 and x = 2
numerator_at_negative_3 = numerator.subs(x, -3)
numerator_at_2 = numerator.subs(x, 2)

# If the numerator is not zero at these points, then the statement is correct
asymptotes_verification = {
    "-3": numerator_at_negative_3 != 0,
    "2": numerator_at_2 != 0

I have some known conditions:
1. The function in question is \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \).
2. The function has vertical asymptotes at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\).

And I want to 1. Determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function..
Help me to determine if the objective can be obtained based on the known conditions or the objective is already one of the current conditions.

### assistant: 
The objective you've stated is to determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function, \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \).

The known conditions that you have provided include:

1. The function in question, which is already given in the first condition (not a judgment, just a fact).
2. The function has vertical asymptotes at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).

Given the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \), vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is equal to zero since the value of \( y \) approaches infinity. The denominator is a quadratic equation, \( x^2 + x - 6 \), which can be factored to \( (x + 3)(x - 2) \). The roots of the quadratic, where it is equal to zero, are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). These are the values of \( x \) at which the function is undefined and the graph has vertical asymptotes.

Therefore, the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function is indeed 2, as stated by the known condition #2. The objective can be obtained based on the known conditions, and in fact, the objective is already satisfied by the second condition. So the judgment is:

The second condition you provided already states the number of vertical asymptotes accurately, which is two: \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \). Hence, the objective has been met.

Help me to come up with one solution targeting at our objective. 

Example 1:
Known conditions: 
1. f(3) = 5
2. for all x > 0, f(3x) = f(x) + 2
3. Because f(3x) = f(x) + 2, so f(9) = f(3) + 2
4. Because f(3x) = f(x) + 2, and f(3) = 5, so f(9) = 7
5. Because f(3x) = f(x) + 2, so f(27) = f(9) + 2
Objective:
find $f^{-1}(11)$
Solutions:
Step 1:
Use f(9) to find f(27)
Step 2:
Use f(27) to find f(81)
Step 3:
Repeat until find x that f(x) = 11

Example 2:
Known conditions: 
1. a + 1 / b = 22 / 7
2. b + 1 / c = 8
3. abc = 21
4. c = 1 / (8 - b)
5. a = (22 / 7) - (1 / b) 
Objective:
Calaculate c + 1 / a
Solutions:
Step 1:
Substitude a in abc = 21 by (22 / 7) - (1 / b) 
Step 2:
Substitude c in abc = 21 by 1 / (8 - b) 
Step 3:
Calculate b 
Step 4:
Calculate a and c
Step 5:
Calculate c + 1 / a

Real question:
Known conditions:
1. The function in question is \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \).
2. The function has vertical asymptotes at \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\).

Objective:
1. Determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of the given function.
Solutions:

### assistant: 
Solutions:
Step 1:
Factor the denominator of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) to find its roots.

Step 2:
Set the denominator equal to zero, \( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \), and solve for \( x \).

Step 3:
Identify the \( x \)-values where the function is undefined as these will be the vertical asymptotes.

Step 4:
Count the unique \( x \)-values obtained in Step 3 to determine the number of vertical asymptotes.
