Problem 1 -> 6\pi+2
Problem 2 -> \frac{5}{3}
Problem 3 -> 6
Problem 4 -> \frac{7}{20} 

7/15! Note how this is the 3rd or so time running chain 4, and the other times it got like 3/15..

I guess I should be doing the averaging differently. also.

r1: 1/5. r2: 2/5. r3:3/5. avg. 2/5. hmmmmmm

***First fully async run btw! Took only 13m :)***
