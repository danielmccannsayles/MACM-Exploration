### Step

### Steps:

**Step 1: Identify All Possible Combinations**
- List all possible sets of integers `(a, b, c)` where `1 <= a < b < c <= 6`. The given possible sets are:
  - (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 6)
  - (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 6), (1, 5, 6)
  - (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6), (2, 5, 6)
  - (3, 4, 5), (3, 4, 6), (3, 5, 6), (4, 5, 6)

**Step 2: Apply the Triangle Inequality Condition**
- For each set `(a, b, c)`, verify if the triangle inequality conditions `a + b > c`, `a + c > b`, and `b + c > a` are satisfied.

**Step 3: Filter Out Non-Satisfying Combinations**
- Eliminate any sets that do not meet all three conditions of the triangle inequality.

**Step 4: Count the Valid Combinations**
- Count the number of sets that satisfy the triangle inequality to determine how many valid combinations exist.

**Step 5: Calculate Total Possible Sets**
- Determine the total number of initially listed possible sets from step 1. This should match the provided list of 20 sets.

**Step 6: Calculate Probability**
- Calculate the probability that a randomly selected set forms a triangle. This is done by dividing the number of valid triangle sets from step 4 by the total number of sets from step 5.

**Step 7: Verify Probability Results**
- Ensure that the probability is calculated correctly and encompasses all possible cases to verify accuracy.
