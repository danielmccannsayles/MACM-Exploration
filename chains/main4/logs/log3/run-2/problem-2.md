### Step
Certainly! Here are the steps to calculate the value of \( AD/CD \) using the known conditions:

**Steps:**

**Step 1:**
Identify that triangle ABC satisfies the triangle inequality criterion using the given side lengths AB = 7, AC = 8, and BC = 9. This confirms that ABC is a valid triangle.

**Step 2:**
Recognize that point D lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC and that AD bisects angle BAC, invoking the angle bisector theorem.

**Step 3:**
Apply the angle bisector theorem to triangle ABC. According to the theorem, \( \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} \). Use the given side lengths to set up the proportion \( \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{7}{8} \).

**Step 4:**
Recognize that since AD is an angle bisector, \( \frac{AD}{CD} \) doesn't directly follow from \( \frac{BD}{DC} \), as it applies to a different configuration. Ensure clarity that the main interest is the side ratio influenced by AD being an angle bisector.

**Step 5:**
If relevant, review existing theorems and approaches within geometry that offer a connection between AD, BD, and DC, such as the angle bisector length formula, which may relate calculation with AC, AB, and segment lengths linked through the circumscribed circle properties.

**Step 6:**
Confirm through additional auxiliary elements or re-evaluation if further refinement required the Pythagorean theorem or other geometric identities due to AD's bisector and point D's use on the circumcircle.

**Step 7:**
Validate any additional steps to solidify \( \frac{AD}{CD} \), but inherently recognize the angle bisector theorem orchestrates the main pathway to obtain necessary segment-length ratios relating segments, angles, and ultimately the sought ratio.

By following these steps, you maximize the geometric relationship understanding required to find \( \frac{AD}{CD} \) efficiently and accurately.
### Step
Certainly! Here is a structured list of steps to solve for the value of AD/CD, utilizing the known conditions and ensuring a coherent logical flow:

**Steps:**

**Step 1:** Verify that Triangle ABC satisfies the triangle inequality condition for validity.

**Step 2:** Use the cosine rule to compute cos(A) of Triangle ABC given the side lengths.

**Step 3:** Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem on Triangle ABC to find the ratio of BD to DC. According to the theorem, the segments opposite the bisected angle satisfy the relation \( \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} \).

**Step 4:** Use the computed ratio \( \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{7}{8} \) to understand the division of segment BC by point D, specifically as it occurs along the angle bisector.

**Step 5:** Recognize that point D is on the circumcircle. Utilize additional properties or characteristics of a point on the circumcircle, if necessary, to reconsider how the triangle's configuration might assist in determining AD/CD.

**Step 6:** From the geometric relationships established and potential trigonometric implications of D being on the circumcircle, explore if any intrinsic geometric properties or additional theorems (such as power of a point or other angle-based rules like inscribed angles) help relate AD and CD directly or indirectly.

**Step 7:** Calculate the exact proportion or ratio \( \frac{AD}{CD} \) using detailed geometric, trigonometric calculations, ensuring all considerations from previous steps contribute to mortar an accurate determination of this ratio, either through deduced geometric constraints or direct geometric reasoning.

**Step 8:** Review all assumptions and ensure consistency with geometric theorems for a finalized, justified answer for AD/CD.

With these steps, you navigate through the essential conditions and theorems necessary to establish the ratio of AD to CD, specifically involving points and segments special to the triangle's geometry and its circumcircle.
