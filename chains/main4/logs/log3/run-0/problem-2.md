### Step

Step 1:  
Apply the angle bisector theorem to find the lengths of BD and DC using the known condition \(\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{7}{8}\) and the condition \(BD + DC = 9\).

Step 2:  
Express BD and DC in terms of a single variable, using the condition from Step 1.

Step 3:  
Solve for the lengths of BD and DC from the equation derived in Step 2.

Step 4:  
Calculate the length of AD using the geometric mean condition: AD is the geometric mean of BD and DC, i.e., \(AD = \sqrt{BD \times DC}\).

Step 5:  
With the lengths found, calculate the value of the ratio \(AD/DC\).
### Step
Sure, let's create a structured list of steps to solve for \( AD/CD \) using the known conditions provided:

### Steps:

**Step 1: Use the Angle Bisector Theorem**
- According to the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio of the segments \( BD \) and \( DC \) is equal to the ratio of the adjacent sides of triangle \( ABC \).
- Therefore, express \( BD \) and \( DC \) in terms of a single variable \( x \) such that \( \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{7}{8} \).

**Step 2: Set Up the Equation for \( BD \) and \( DC \)**
- Let \( BD = 7x \) and \( DC = 8x \).
- Write the equation based on the condition \( BD + DC = 9 \).
  
**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**
- Solve the equation \( 7x + 8x = 9 \) to find the value of \( x \).

**Step 4: Determine the Lengths of \( BD \) and \( DC \)**
- Substitute the value of \( x \) back into the expressions for \( BD = 7x \) and \( DC = 8x \) to find the actual lengths of \( BD \) and \( DC \).

**Step 5: Using the Angle Bisector Property**
- Notice that \( AD \) divides \( \angle BAC \) and is not necessarily the geometric mean without assuming additional properties.
- Focus on establishing a relationship or calculating the length of \( AD \) based on \( BD \) and \( DC \).

**Step 6: Calculate \( AD/CD \)**
- Now, use the values calculated for \( BD \), \( DC \), and any necessary computations or proven relationships to find the value of \( AD/CD \).

**Step 7: Verify All Calculations**
- Double-check the calculations and ensure they adhere to all known conditions, confirming that the steps and solutions maintain logical consistency.

These steps should guide you through establishing the relationship required to find \( AD/CD \) while incorporating the known conditions specific to triangle \( ABC \).

Steps:
Steps:

Step 1:
Use the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides, to express the ratios of BD and DC with respect to AB and AC:  
\[ \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{7}{8} \]

Step 2:
Set up the equation for the segments using the condition:  
BD + DC = BC = 9.

Step 3:
Solve for BD and DC using the equation:  
Let BD = 7x and DC = 8x.  
Thus, 7x + 8x = 9.

Step 4:
Calculate BD and DC by solving 15x = 9 to find x, then compute BD = 7x and DC = 8x.

Step 5:
Use the property that the length of the line segment AD is the geometric mean of the lengths of the segments BD and DC (since AD bisects \(\angle BAC\) and D is on the circumcircle).  
Set up the equation:  
AD = \(\sqrt{BD \times DC}\).

Step 6:
Calculate the value of AD using the values of BD and DC obtained.

Step 7:
Finally, calculate the ratio AD/CD using the previously determined values.
