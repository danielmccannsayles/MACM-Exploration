### Step

Steps:

Step 1: 
Identify the coordinates of points W, X, Y, and Z based on the alignment of small squares within the outer square. Use the known side lengths and alignment conditions to determine these points.

Step 2: 
Use the symmetry of square ABCD around the center of the outer square to determine the positions of points A, B, C, and D relative to W, X, Y, and Z. Ensure that these points adhere to the specification of having x-coordinates of at least 2 or y-coordinates of at least 1.

Step 3: 
Validate the positioning of points A, B, C, and D with respect to the condition that square ABCD encircles points W, X, Y, and Z, and aligns symmetrically with the outer square.

Step 4: 
Locate point A specifically at (2, 0) as given, focusing on maximizing the distance to point P(6, 0) based on specified constraints and symmetry.

Step 5:
Calculate the distance from point A at (2, 0) to point P at (6, 0) using the distance formula.

Step 6:
Confirm that this distance aligns with maximizing conditions specified within the constraints, maintaining compliance with ABCD and its symmetric orientation inside the outer square.
### Step
Steps:

Step 1:  
Identify the coordinates of point A. Based on the known conditions, point A is located at (2, 0).

Step 2:  
Identify the coordinates of point P. It is given as (6, 0).

Step 3:  
Apply the distance formula to calculate the distance from point A to point P. Use the formula \( \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \), where \((x_1, y_1)\) are the coordinates of A and \((x_2, y_2)\) are the coordinates of P.

Step 4:  
Substitute the coordinates of A and P into the distance formula to find the maximum distance.

Step 5:  
Compute the distance based on the values calculated in Step 4.
