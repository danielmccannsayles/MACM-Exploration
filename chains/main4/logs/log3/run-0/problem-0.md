### Step
Step 1:  
Use the given altitudes from point P to determine the areas of the three smaller triangles formed by point P and the sides AB, BC, and CA.

Step 2:  
Apply the known condition that the area of the equilateral triangle ABC is equal to the sum of the areas of these three smaller triangles. Use this to set up an equation representing the total area of triangle ABC.

Step 3:  
Express the area of triangle ABC in terms of its side length, using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: \(\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\), where \(s\) is the side length.

Step 4:  
Use the equation derived from Step 2 to express the sum of the areas of the smaller triangles in terms of \(\text{side length} \times \text{altitude}/2\) for each of the smaller triangles.

Step 5:  
Solve the equation for the side length \(s\) of triangle ABC.

Step 6:  
Calculate the area of equilateral triangle ABC using the side length found in Step 5 with the area formula from Step 3.
### Step
1. **Identify Key Values**:
   - Recognize the known altitudes from point P to sides AB, BC, and CA are 5, 6, and 7, respectively.
   - Recall that the given altitudes will help cross-verify the internal point property of the triangle.

2. **Understand the Relation of Areas**:
   - Remember that the sum of the areas of the triangles APB, BPC, and CPA created using point P and the altitudes to the sides equals the area of triangle ABC.
   - Use the areas of smaller triangles given by \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).

3. **Recognize Properties of Equilateral Triangles**:
   - Engage the property that the area of an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \).
   - Note this standard formula will be instrumental when calculating the total area once the side is known.

4. **Formulate the Sum of Areas**:
   - Introduce and express each smaller triangle's area using 5, 6, and 7 as the respective altitudes and side \( s \) as the base.
   - Calculate these expressions: \( \frac{1}{2}s \times 5 \), \( \frac{1}{2}s \times 6 \), \( \frac{1}{2}s \times 7 \).

5. **Establish the Total Area and Equate**:
   - Sum up: \( \text{Area of ABC} = \frac{1}{2}s \times 5 + \frac{1}{2}s \times 6 + \frac{1}{2}s \times 7 \).

6. **Relate to Standard Formula**:
   - Set the sum from the above step equal to \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \) to solve for side length \( s \).
   - Simplify and solve the equation.

7. **Calculate the Final Area**:
   - Substitute the value of \( s \) back into \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \) to find the area of triangle ABC.

8. **Verify the Consistency**:
   - Ensure the solution aligns with the proportionality to the sum of altitudes and internal geometry properties outlined in step understanding.

Objectives:
1. Find the area of equilateral triangle ABC
Steps:
Step 1:  
Verify that the altitudes from Point P to the sides of triangle ABC are consistent with the properties of an equilateral triangle. Use geometric reasoning or proofs as needed to ensure that such specific altitudes (5, 6, 7) from an internal point are valid for an equilateral triangle setup.

Step 2:  
Determine the side length \( s \) of the equilateral triangle ABC. Use the relationship between the altitudes from point P and the side of an equilateral triangle to find expressions for the side length \( s \) based on the given altitudes. 

Step 3:  
Substantiate the derivation of \( s \) by evaluating the sum of the areas of the three smaller triangles formed by the altitudes from Point P with the corresponding sides. The sum should equal the area of triangle ABC to satisfy condition 5.

Step 4:  
Utilize the standard area formula for an equilateral triangle: \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \). Calculate the side length \( s \) found in Step 2 to derive the area of triangle ABC.

Step 5:  
Validate the result by comparing the calculated area with consistent geometric properties or mathematical checks associated with equilateral triangles, ensuring the solution aligns with known conditions and constraints.

Step 6:  
Conclude with the area of equilateral triangle ABC using the logically verified and calculated side length \( s \).
