1. Dakota selects three different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
2. The sides of a triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem
1. Calculate the probability that the three numbers selected can be the sides of a triangle
## Mined new conditions from existing (1/3):Unchecked Conditions (1/3)
1. based_on_known_conditions=[0, 1] new_condition='The selected integers a, b, and c must satisfy a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a.' reason='The triangle inequality theorem states that for three numbers to be the sides of a triangle, the sum of any two numbers must be greater than the third. This condition derives directly from Condition 2.'
2. based_on_known_conditions=[0] new_condition='There are 20 possible ways to select three different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.' reason='This is calculated using combinations: choosing 3 integers from a set of 6 is represented as C(6,3) = 6!/(3!(6-3)!) = 20. This condition is purely a combinatorial calculation based on Condition 1.'
3. based_on_known_conditions=[0, 1] new_condition='Possible sets of three numbers that satisfy the triangle inequality from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} are: {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5}, {3, 5, 6}, {4, 5, 6}.' reason='By applying the triangle inequality theorem derived from Conditions 0 and 1 to each combination of three numbers from the set, only these four satisfy the condition. It helps narrow down the valid combinations needed to reach the objective.'
