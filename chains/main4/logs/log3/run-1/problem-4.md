## Mined new conditions from existing (1/3):Unchecked Conditions (1/3)
1. based_on_known_conditions=[0] new_condition='The maximum sum of any two selected numbers should be greater than the third number for a valid triangle formation.' reason='This condition arises from the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any three numbers to be sides of a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.'
2. based_on_known_conditions=[0] new_condition='Each selected number must be less than the sum of the other two selected numbers.' reason='This is another form of the triangle inequality theorem, emphasizing that each side should be less than the sum of the other two sides to form a triangle.'
3. based_on_known_conditions=[0] new_condition='Any combination where the largest selected integer is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two integers cannot be used to form a triangle.' reason='This condition is derived from the contrapositive of the triangle inequality theorem, ensuring that the selected numbers meet one of the fundamental properties of triangles.'
Verifying condition #1
Verified
The maximum sum of any two selected numbers should be greater than the third number for a valid triangle formation.
Verifying condition #2
Verified
The selected numbers must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, i.e., each number must be less than the sum of the other two numbers.
Verifying condition #3
Verified
Any combination where the largest selected integer is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two integers cannot be used to form a triangle.
All Conditions: 
1. Dakota selects three different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
2. The maximum sum of any two selected numbers should be greater than the third number for a valid triangle formation.
3. The selected numbers must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, i.e., each number must be less than the sum of the other two numbers.
4. Any combination where the largest selected integer is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two integers cannot be used to form a triangle.
Do we have answer?: True
### Step
Step 1:
List all possible combinations of selecting three different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Step 2:
For each combination, verify if the maximum sum of any two selected numbers is greater than the third number to ensure a valid triangle formation.

Step 3:
Check each combination against the triangle inequality theorem; ensure each number is less than the sum of the other two numbers.

Step 4:
Identify and count the number of combinations that satisfy both the maximum sum condition and the triangle inequality theorem.

Step 5:
Calculate the total number of valid triangle-forming combinations.

Step 6:
Determine the total number of ways to choose three integers from the set.

Step 7:
Calculate the probability by dividing the number of valid combinations by the total number of possible combinations.

Optional Comments:
This method ensures a systematic approach to evaluate all possible combinations against the triangle inequality theorem. Adjustments in calculating combinations or conditions can be made based on problem-specific constraints if necessary.
### Step
Step 1:
Identify all possible combinations of three different integers selected from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. There are 20 such combinations.

Step 2:
For each combination, apply the triangle inequality theorem. Check if the sum of any two numbers is greater than the third number for all three possible pairs within the combination.

Step 3:
List all combinations that satisfy the triangle inequality for all three conditions.

Step 4:
Count the number of combinations that form valid triangles based on the criteria from Step 3.

Step 5:
Calculate the probability by dividing the number of valid triangle-forming combinations by the total number of combinations identified in Step 1.

Optional Comment:
Ensure the interpretation of the triangle inequality is applied consistently across all combinations to maintain accuracy in determining valid triangles.
Approved
