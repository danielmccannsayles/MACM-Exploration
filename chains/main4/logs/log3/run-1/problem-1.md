### Step
Steps:

Step 1:
Examine the region described by Inequality 1: \((x-4)^2 + y^2 \leq 16\). This represents a circle centered at \((4, 0)\) with radius 4. Identify its boundaries and key points of intersection with the other inequalities.

Step 2:
Analyze the linear region described by Inequality 2: \(y \geq x - 4\). Determine where this line intersects the circle to find boundary points relevant to the region.

Step 3:
Consider Inequality 3: \(y \geq -\frac{1}{3}x\). Identify where this line intersects the circle and any potential boundary intersections with Inequality 2.

Step 4:
Identify the vertices of the region formed by the intersection of the three inequalities. Given in the conditions are the intersection points of the lines with the circle: \((0, 0)\) and \((7.2, -2.4)\).

Step 5:
Determine the shape of the intersection region by considering how the inequalities enclose a portion of the circle. This region is bounded by segments of the circle and sections of the lines \(y = x-4\) and \(y = -\frac{1}{3}x\).

Step 6:
Calculate the segments of the circle defined by the intersections with the lines. Approximate the angles subtended by these segments at the center of the circle \((4, 0)\) using key points from Step 4.

Step 7:
Compute the area of circular sectors corresponding to the angle subtended by the intersection points on the circle. Adjust for sections where linear inequalities define boundaries.

Step 8:
Find the total area of the intersection region by summing the areas of circular segments and triangular or quadrilateral regions formed by the linear inequalities.

Step 9:
Express the area found in Step 8 in terms of \(\pi\), incorporating the circle segment areas calculated using circular geometry.
### Step
Step 1:  
Identify the region described by Inequality 1, which is a circle centered at (4, 0) with radius 4.

Step 2:  
Determine how Inequality 2 (y ≥ x-4) affects the region from Inequality 1 by identifying the line y = x - 4 and noting that it restricts the allowable region to one half of the plane relative to this line.

Step 3:  
Analyze the effects of Inequality 3 (y ≥ -1/3x) on the region, noting that as a boundary, it further restricts the region to one above this line.

Step 4:  
Verify the points of intersection of these linear boundaries with the circle by solving the system of equations formed by y = x - 4 and y = -1/3x with the circle's equation (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16 to confirm given intersection points.

Step 5:  
Identify the resulting geometrical region formed by the intersection of the circle and the two linear inequalities. Note critical points defining this region including (0,0), (8,4), and the verified points of intersection with the circle's boundary.

Step 6:  
Construct a visual representation of this region, highlighting the relevant segments of the circle and linear boundaries formed through step-by-step logical and algebraic inspection.

Step 7:  
Calculate the areas of the segments of the circle inside the intersection region, using appropriate sector formulas and taking angles with the center at (4,0). This involves integrating or using circle-segment area formulas for portions constrained by the circle's intersections with the lines.

Step 8:  
Combine the circular and triangular areas within the region by considering only overlapping segments determined by the geometric construction.

Step 9:  
Express the total calculated area of the region in terms of \(\pi\), ensuring consistency with geometrical computations and mathematical accuracy in expressing the areas of circle sectors.

Step 10:  
Recheck all calculations and provided steps to substantiate the final solution and accuracy of the area expression in terms of \(\pi\). Confirm correctness before presenting the final answer.
