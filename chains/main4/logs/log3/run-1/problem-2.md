### Step
Step 1:  
Verify the properties of triangle ABC, ensuring that side lengths satisfy the conditions of a scalene triangle (AB ≠ AC ≠ BC).

Step 2:  
Use the angle bisector theorem, which states that the ratio of BD to DC is equal to the ratio of AB to AC, to express BD/DC = AB/AC and confirm this ratio is 7/8.

Step 3:  
By condition, point D divides arc BC in the ratio AB:AC, implying BD/DC = 7/8.

Step 4:  
Recognize that because AD bisects angle BAC and divides arc BC corresponding to sides AB and AC on the circumscribed circle, D is positioned according to these segment ratios.

Step 5:  
Utilize the angle bisector theorem again to express AD/DB = AC/BC and AC and BC's known lengths to find AD in relation to DB, keeping in mind that AD = DC because AD is part of the bisector.

Step 6:  
Set the equation involving known ratios and side lengths to solve for AD/CD, using the derived relationships from steps 2 and 3.

Step 7:  
Calculate the ratio of AD to CD with all derived relations and known conditions, confirming consistency with conditions (e.g., symmetry from the angle bisector).

Step 8:  
Verify calculations by ensuring no condition is contradicted, considering the geometric properties of point D, such as circle symmetry and segment division.
### Step
Step 1:
Use the given lengths of sides AB, AC, and BC to verify that triangle ABC is scalene, using the fact that no sides are equal.

Step 2:
Calculate the semi-perimeter of triangle ABC for Heron’s formula by using the formula: \( s = \frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} \).

Step 3:
Calculate the area of triangle ABC using Heron’s formula: \( \text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)} \).

Step 4:
Recognize that AD is an angle bisector of angle BAC, and apply the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that \( \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} \).

Step 5:
Given that point D is on the circumscribed circle and divides arc BC in the ratio \( AB:AC \), confirm or validate relationships or symmetries that might assist later, though primarily focusing on the bisector impact on side ratios first.

Step 6:
Using the Angle Bisector Theorem again, understand the specific triangle geometry. Construct the relationship \(\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{7}{8}\) coming directly from the theorem.

Step 7:
Having established the ratio of \( BD:DC \), equate it to \( AD:CD \) indirectly using proportional triangle segments formed by the bisector.

Step 8:
Conclude with the equation of ratios or lengths translated from \(\frac{BD}{DC}\), focusing on how this binds into the equation involving AD, leading to the calculation of \(\frac{AD}{CD}\).

Step 9:
Calculate or express the ratio \( \frac{AD}{CD} \) by deriving any intermediary steps or calculations from established proportions accurately. Confirm validity through derived relationships strictly based on the known conditions and applicable theorems.
## Final

1. In triangle ABC, side AB = 7
2. In triangle ABC, side AC = 8
3. In triangle ABC, side BC = 9
4. Point D is on the circumscribed circle of triangle ABC
5. Line segment AD bisects angle BAC

8. Angle ADB is congruent to angle ADC.
9. The ratio of the lengths of sides AB to AC is equal to the ratio of segments BD to DC.
10. AD is an angle bisector of angle BAC
11. Point D divides arc BC in the ratio AB:AC
Objectives:
1. Calculate the ratio of AD to CD
Steps:
Step 1:  
Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to triangle ABC, which states that if a point D lies on the bisector of angle BAC, then the ratio of the lengths of the segments BD to DC is equal to the ratio of the lengths of sides AB to AC.

Step 2:  
Use the given ratio AB:AC from the known conditions (7:8) to determine the ratio of BD to DC. According to the Angle Bisector Theorem, \( \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{7}{8} \).

Step 3:  
Acknowledge that since AD is the angle bisector, point D divides arc BC in the ratio AB:AC, which matches the previously found ratio from Step 2, confirming the configuration consistency.

Step 4:  
Recognize that the ratio \( \frac{AD}{CD} \) must be related to the same geometric construction but require further specific analysis involving perhaps additional circle properties, such as power of a point or alternate application of the bisector theorem involving cyclic quadrilaterals. However, any such usage needs rigorous justification within known facts or geometrical theorems.

Step 5:  
Conclude that further geometric properties or theorems specific to given configurations need to be considered to precisely relate AD and CD, and without it, emphasizing the known result and its geometric significance within circle properties or secant-tangent principles remains imperative. Evaluate the specific context if additional rules beyond basic Angle Bisector outcomes are necessary for solving \(\frac{AD}{CD}\) directly.
