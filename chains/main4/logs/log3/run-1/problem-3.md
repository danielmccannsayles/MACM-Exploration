### Step
Step 1:
Determine the arrangement of small squares '1', '2', '3', and '4' in the corners of Square 'E' to understand the available space for Square 'ABCD'.

Step 2:
Recognize that the effective inner area of Square 'E', as mentioned in condition 13, has a side length of 2 due to the placement of the small squares in each corner.

Step 3:
Use the fact that the vertices 'W', 'X', 'Y', and 'Z' of Square 'ABCD' form the square within this effective inner area and lie on the diagonals of Square 'E' as per condition 11.

Step 4:
Since the effective inner side of Square 'E' is 2, calculate the maximum possible side length of Square 'ABCD' that fits within this area.

Step 5:
Use the relation of diagonals in a square, where the diagonal \(d = s\sqrt{2}\) for a square with side length \(s\), to find the maximum possible diagonal of Square 'ABCD' within the available space.

Step 6:
Calculate the maximum distance from 'A' to 'P', which is equal to the diagonal of Square 'ABCD', using the identified side length from the previous step.
