### Step
Step 1:
Understand the layout of the larger square and its division into nine smaller squares, each with a side length of 2.

Step 2:
Identify the positions of points W, X, Y, and Z within the larger square. These points are the vertices of the smaller squares located at the corners.

Step 3:
Determine the possible configurations of square ABCD that pass through points W, X, Y, and Z.

Step 4:
Consider the alignment and rotation of square ABCD within the larger square, noting that it is centered. 

Step 5:
Calculate the possible positions of point A in square ABCD based on the known vertex positions and center alignment.

Step 6:
Explore the diagonal distance from point A to the opposite corner of square ABCD, as this will influence the maximum possible distance to point P.

Step 7:
Evaluate various geometric constructions to ensure that point A achieves the maximum possible distance from a central point P.

Step 8:
Use calculated distances and geometric relationships to determine the maximum distance from point A to point P while adhering to the conditions set by the problem.

Step 9:
Verify the solution by checking the alignment of square ABCD and ensuring it remains centered to validate the calculation of the maximum distance.
### Step
Step 1:
Define the layout of the larger square with vertices and identify the position of the nine smaller squares of side length 2 within the larger square.

Step 2:
Identify the position of the four smaller squares that have vertices W, X, Y, and Z, given they are in the corners of the larger square.

Step 3:
Since square ABCD passes through W, X, Y, and Z, determine the position and orientation of square ABCD within the larger square.

Step 4:
Establish the coordinates of points W, X, Y, and Z based on their positions as vertices of the smaller squares in the corners of the larger square.

Step 5:
Calculate the center of square ABCD by averaging the coordinates of points W, X, Y, and Z.

Step 6:
Determine the coordinates of point A, ensuring that square ABCD is centered within the larger square and aligned correctly through points W, X, Y, and Z.

Step 7:
Clearly define the location and role of point P. Verify whether P is fixed at a specific position or if it varies within certain constraints.

Step 8:
Establish the relationship between point A and point P, taking into account any constraints or variations in their positions.

Step 9:
Calculate the maximum possible distance from point A to point P, ensuring all conditions and constraints are considered.

Step 10:
Review and verify each step to ensure the logical consistency and correctness of the approach to determine the maximum possible distance.

2. The larger square has a side length of 6
3. Points W, X, Y, and Z are vertices of these smaller squares
4. Square ABCD is constructed passing through points W, X, Y, and Z
5. The larger square can be divided into nine smaller squares with side length 2.

7. Square ABCD is centered within the larger square.
Objectives:
1. Determine the maximum possible distance from point A to point P
Steps:
Step 1:
Define the positions of the vertices W, X, Y, and Z of the four smaller squares. Note their coordinates in the coordinate plane with the origin at one corner of the larger square and carefully note that these points are at the vertices and not center points of the squares.

Step 2:
Understand the configuration of square ABCD by determining its sides as parallel or diagonal connections between these points: W, X, Y, and Z. Note any symmetry or alignment with the larger square that might influence its positioning.

Step 3:
Introduce point P within the context of the square ABCD. Clarify allowable placements for P that maximize its distance from point A and consider how P could be located based on the square's orientation and position.

Step 4:
Calculate the distances from point A to various potential positions for P, considering placements that maximize this distance while adhering to any constraints (e.g., P remaining within or on the boundary of square ABCD).

Step 5:
Determine the configuration of square ABCD that maximizes the distance AP by potentially considering diagonal positions for A to a P located at one of ABCD's opposite corners or diagonal inter-segments.

Step 6:
Verify calculations and validate the placement of A and P to ensure they are consistent with known conditions, especially considering the positioning constraints within ABCD and the larger square boundary constraints.

Step 7:
Conclude which configurations and positions offer maximum AP distance, refining any earlier assumptions or coordinates if needed based on alignment and geometric constraints demonstrated in previous steps.
