### Step
Step 1:
Use the given summation of perpendiculars from point P to the sides of triangle ABC (5 + 6 + 7 = 18) and the relationship that this sum equals the side length of triangle ABC divided by the square root of 3.

Step 2:
Solve for the side length of triangle ABC using the relationship between the perimeter of the triangle and the sum of perpendiculars from point P.

Step 3:
Calculate the altitude (h) of triangle ABC using the side length obtained from Step 2.

Step 4:
Use the altitude (h) and the side length to determine the area of triangle ABC using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times \text{(side length)}^2\).

Optional Comments:
This approach leverages geometric properties of equilateral triangles and the specific relationship between internal perpendiculars and side length.

Steps:

Step 1:  
Understand that the sum of the perpendicular distances from an internal point to the sides of an equilateral triangle is related to the side length of the triangle via known geometric properties.

Step 2:  
Determine the side length of triangle ABC by using the sum of the altitudes from point P to sides AB, BC, and CA. Use the relationship that the sum of these altitudes (18 in this case) equals the side length of the triangle divided by the square root of 3.

Step 3:  
Calculate the side length of triangle ABC using the equation:  
side length = 18 * sqrt(3).

Step 4:  
Apply the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:  
Area = (sqrt(3)/4) * (side length)^2.

Step 5:  
Substitute the calculated side length from Step 3 into the area formula obtained in Step 4 to find the area of triangle ABC.

Step 6:  
Review each calculation to verify the logical consistency and correctness, ensuring no extraneous details from the internal point P were used beyond determining side length in Step 2.
