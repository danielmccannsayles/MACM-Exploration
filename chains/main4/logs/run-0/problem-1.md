### Step
Step 1:
Interpret Inequality 1 as a circle with center at (4, 0) and radius 4.

Step 2:
Rewrite and interpret Inequality 4 as a circle: (x-4)^2 + y^2 \leq 16, which is equivalent to Inequality 1.

Step 3:
Interpret Inequality 2 as the boundary of a half-plane above or on the line y = x - 4.

Step 4:
Interpret Inequality 3 as the boundary of a half-plane above or on the line y = -\frac{1}{3}x.

Step 5:
Identify the intersection of the half-plane y \geq x - 4 with the circle (x-4)^2 + y^2 \leq 16.

Step 6:
Identify the intersection of the half-plane y \geq -\frac{1}{3}x with the circle (x-4)^2 + y^2 \leq 16.

Step 7:
Determine the area of the region that is common to all the conditions: the circle, the line y = x - 4, and the line y = -\frac{1}{3}x.

Step 8:
Calculate the area of this enclosed region considering geometric properties such as sectors of the circle and the intersections with the lines.
Approved
