This is a classic property of equilateral triangles, given by Viviani's theorem."
2. based_on_known_conditions=[1, 2, 3, 4] new_condition='The altitude of triangle ABC is 18 units.' reason="Using Viviani's theorem for equilateral triangles, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of the triangle equals the altitude of the triangle. Here, these distances are 5, 6, and 7 units, which add up to 18 units."
3. based_on_known_conditions=[1] new_condition='The area of triangle ABC is \\((s^2 * \\sqrt{3})/4\\) where s is the side length and the altitude is (s * \\sqrt{3})/2 = 18 units.' reason='The altitude 18 units can be used to find the side length using the formula for the altitude of an equilateral triangle: \\( altitude = (s * \\sqrt{3})/2 \\). Solving for s gives the side length, which can then be used to calculate the area using the area formula for an equilateral triangle.'

### Step

Step 1:  
Use the known condition that the altitude of triangle ABC is 18 units to find the side length \(s\) of the equilateral triangle using the formula \((s \times \sqrt{3})/2 = 18\).

Step 2:  
Solve the equation from Step 1 to find the side length \(s\).

Step 3:  
Use the side length \(s\) obtained in Step 2 in the area formula for an equilateral triangle: \(\text{Area} = (s^2 \times \sqrt{3})/4\).

Step 4:  
Calculate the area of triangle ABC using the formula determined in Step 3.

Step 5:  
Verify that the calculated area is consistent with the given conditions, particularly condition 6 regarding the altitude of the triangle.
