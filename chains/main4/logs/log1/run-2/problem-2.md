Extracted from problem, (conditions, objectives)
1. Triangle ABC has sides AB=7, AC=8, and BC=9
2. Point D is on the circumscribed circle of triangle ABC
3. Line segment AD bisects angle BAC
1. Calculate the value of AD/CD
## Mined new conditions from existing (1/3):Unchecked Conditions (1/3)
1. based_on_known_conditions=[1, 2, 3] new_condition='Triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC.' reason='The angle bisector AD implies a special property of a triangle. Since D is on the circumcircle, and AD is an angle bisector, the concept of isogonal conjugate in circle geometry applies, which often relates to isosceles triangles.'
2. based_on_known_conditions=[0, 3] new_condition='AD/CD = AB/BC = 7/9.' reason='By the angle bisector theorem in triangle properties, the angle bisector divides the opposite side in the ratio of the adjacent sides. As AD bisects angle BAC, the line segment ratios must conform to this.'
3. based_on_known_conditions=[1] new_condition='Length of AD can be derived using the Law of Cosines in combination with Ptolemy’s Theorem.' reason='With D on the circumcircle and triangle geometry, using known side lengths and circumcircle properties, Ptolemy’s Theorem can relate the sides and diagonals to find AD.'

Do we have answer?: True
### Step
Step 1:  
Use the Law of Cosines to calculate the angles of triangle ABC. 

Step 2:  
Determine the circumradius of the triangle ABC using the formula \( R = \frac{abc}{4K} \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the sides of the triangle, and \( K \) is the area of the triangle.

Step 3:  
Use the circumradius and the coordinates or specific points of triangle ABC to verify the location of point D on the circumcircle.

Step 4:  
Apply Ptolemy's Theorem for the cyclic quadrilateral ABDC formed by the circumscribed circle, using the sides and positions of points A, B, C, and D.

Step 5:  
Use the fact that AD bisects angle BAC to determine the relationship between segments AD and CD.

Step 6:  
Combine the results from Ptolemy’s Theorem and the angle bisector properties to derive a formula or expression for AD in terms of known sides and angles.

Step 7:  
Solve the expressions to find the ratio \( \frac{AD}{CD} \).
### Step
Steps:

Step 1:
Verify that point D lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC and thus forms a cyclic quadrilateral with points A, B, and C.

Step 2:
Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that AD/CD = AB/BC, to use the angle bisector property given in the known conditions.

Step 3:
Substitute the known lengths of AB and BC into the angle bisector relationship: AD/CD = AB/BC = 7/9.

Step 4:
Using the established ratio from Step 3, calculate the value of AD/CD based on the known segment lengths.

Comments:
By directly applying the Angle Bisector Theorem and using the given side lengths, the objective can be achieved in a clear and straightforward manner without unnecessary complication from unrelated results.
