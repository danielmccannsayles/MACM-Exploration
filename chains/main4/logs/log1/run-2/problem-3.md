### Step
Step 1:
Visualize or sketch the large square with side length 6 and position the four smaller squares with side length 2 within it, ensuring they fit perfectly as stated in the known conditions.

Step 2:
Identify the vertices W, X, Y, and Z on the smaller squares that will form the vertices of square ABCD, arranged as a rotated square within the large square.

Step 3:
Understanding the diagonal relationship, place the point P on one of the vertices of the smaller squares and identify how square ABCD is inscribed within the large square, particularly noticing its rotation of 45 degrees.

Step 4:
Determine the diagonal distance across the entire large square, as this relates to the maximum possible distance in the diagonal scenario.

Step 5:
Calculate the diagonal of one smaller square, which would offer insight into how square ABCD, being inscribed and rotated, positions its vertices.

Step 6:
Identify point A as the vertex of square ABCD that is diagonally opposite to point P within the context of the large square's diagonal.

Step 7:
Calculate the distance from point A to point P using the distance across the large square limited by its geometric confines and considering the rotation of square ABCD.
