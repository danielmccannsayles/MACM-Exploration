1. Dakota selects three different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1. Calculate the probability that the selected numbers could be the sides of a triangle
## Mined new conditions from existing (1/3):Unchecked Conditions (1/3)
1. based_on_known_conditions=[0] new_condition='The integers when selected should satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the third side.' reason='The known condition involves selecting integers to form sides of a triangle. The triangle inequality is a fundamental rule in geometry that determines if three lengths can form a valid triangle.'
2. based_on_known_conditions=[0] new_condition='There are 20 possible ways to select 3 different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.' reason='Since Dakota selects three different integers, we need to determine how many such combinations exist from a set of 6 numbers. This provides the total sample space for calculating the probability.'
3. based_on_known_conditions=[0, 1] new_condition='Out of the 20 combinations, there are specific selections {2, 3, 4}, {2, 4, 5}, {3, 4, 5}, {3, 5, 6}, and {4, 5, 6} that satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.' reason='By listing out and testing all 20 combinations against the triangle inequality theorem, we isolate which ones can form valid triangles. This direct observation allows us to calculate the favorable outcomes.'

Do we have answer?: True
### Step

Steps:

Step 1:
Identify the total number of ways to select three different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, which is already given as 20.

Step 2:
List the combinations of integers from the set that satisfy the triangle inequality theorem and are provided as valid: {2, 3, 4}, {2, 4, 5}, {3, 4, 5}, {3, 5, 6}, {4, 5, 6}, {2, 5, 6}, and {3, 4, 6}.

Step 3:
Count the number of valid combinations that satisfy the triangle inequality, which are given as {2, 3, 4}, {2, 4, 5}, {3, 4, 5}, {3, 5, 6}, {4, 5, 6}, {2, 5, 6}, and {3, 4, 6}.

Step 4:
Calculate the probability by dividing the number of valid combinations (from Step 3) by the total number of ways to select the integers (from Step 1).

Step 5:
Express the probability as a fraction or percentage, if needed, based on the result from Step 4.
