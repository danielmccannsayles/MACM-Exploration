Do we have answer?: True
### Step
Step 1:
Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to determine the relationship between segments BD and DC given that line AD is the angle bisector and \( \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{BD}{DC} \).

Step 2:
Use the known lengths of sides AB = 7 and AC = 8 to calculate the ratio \(\frac{BD}{DC}\).

Step 3:
Determine segment relationships involving D using properties of the circumcircle and angle bisectors, specifically considering the fact that point D lies on the circumcircle.

Step 4:
Apply the Intersecting Chord Theorem, if needed, to find additional segment relationships involving AD and CD.

Step 5:
Relate the segments using the information from steps 1-4 to find \(\frac{AD}{CD}\).

Step 6:
Verify the relationships and calculations to ensure the accuracy of the ratio \(\frac{AD}{CD}\).
### Step
Steps:

Step 1:  
Understand the given condition that AB = 7, AC = 8, and BC = 9 to identify triangle ABC's properties and ensure these match the steps leading to the calculation of the desired ratio.

Step 2:  
Recognize that point D lies on the circumcircle, and line AD is the angle bisector of angle BAC. Reflect on the implications of Dâ€™s position on the bisector and identify key circle properties.

Step 3:  
Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem in triangle ABC, which states that \( \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{BD}{DC} \). Use this relationship to understand and refine relationships between segments.

Step 4:  
Investigate implications of the geometric properties of AD as an angle bisector interacting with the circumcircle, noting that D is a point where the angle bisector intersects the circumcircle.

Step 5:  
Evaluate whether the Intersecting Chord Theorem or similar geometric concepts can provide additional information about segments related to D, and establish any necessary connections.

Step 6:  
Directly derive the ratio \( \frac{AD}{CD} \) based on the consequences of D's intersection with the circumcircle and relationships from previous steps, adhering strictly to relevant theorems ensuring clear applicability.

Step 7:  
Cross-check calculations against the known properties and theorems applied in previous steps to confirm logical soundness and accuracy in deriving \( \frac{AD}{CD} \).

Step 8:  
Document all logical steps and relationships comprehensively to ensure transparency and clarity in deriving the requested ratio, ensuring all progressions lead directly from conditions to objective.
