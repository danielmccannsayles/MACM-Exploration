Do we have answer?: True
### Step

Step 1:
List all possible combinations of three different integers that can be selected from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. There are 20 such combinations as given.

Step 2:
For each combination of three integers (let's call them a, b, c), check if they satisfy the triangle inequality conditions: 
- a + b > c
- b + c > a
- a + c > b

Step 3:
Count the number of combinations that satisfy the triangle inequality conditions.

Step 4:
Calculate the probability that the selected numbers can form a triangle by dividing the number of valid combinations (from Step 3) by the total number of combinations (20).

Step 5:
Express the probability from Step 4 as a common fraction.
Approved
