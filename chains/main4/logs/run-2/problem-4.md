### Step
Step 1:  
Determine the total number of ways to select three different integers from the numbers 1 through 6. 

Step 2:  
Verify which of the given sets of integers satisfy the triangle inequality condition. For each set, check if the sum of any two integers is greater than the third integer.

Step 3:  
Count the number of sets that satisfy the triangle inequality condition.

Step 4:  
Calculate the total number of sets from Step 1 that can form the sides of a triangle using the result from Step 3.

Step 5:  
Compute the probability by dividing the number of valid sets (from Step 4) by the total number of sets (from Step 1).
### Step
Sure, here are the steps to solve the objective based on the known conditions:

**Steps:**

**Step 1:**  
Determine the total number of possible combinations for selecting three different integers from the numbers 1 through 6. Use the combination formula \( C(n, k) \) where \( n \) is the total number of options, and \( k = 3 \) for selecting three numbers.

**Step 2:**  
Verify each set listed in the known conditions to ensure all selected integers satisfy the triangle inequality condition: the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. 

**Step 3:**  
Count the number of valid sets from the provided list that adhere to the triangle inequality condition.

**Step 4:**  
Compute the probability that the three selected integers can be the sides of a triangle by dividing the count of valid sets by the total number of combinations calculated in Step 1. 

These steps outline the process for determining the probability that the integers selected can form the sides of a triangle, using the triangle inequality theorem and combinatorial counting principles.
