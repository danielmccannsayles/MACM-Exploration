### Step
Certainly! Here are the steps to find the value of AD/CD given the known conditions:

Step 1: 
Utilize the condition that AD is the angle bisector of angle BAC to employ the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that AD/BD = AC/BC.

Step 2:
Use the relationship from the Angle Bisector Theorem, AD/BD = AC/BC, to determine a proportional relationship involving AD, BD, and CD.

Step 3:
Recognize that since D is on the circumcircle and AD is the angle bisector, point D is the midpoint of the arc BC not containing A, leading to the fact that angle BDC = angle BAC/2.

Step 4:
Apply the Law of Sines in Triangle ABD and Triangle ADC to find expressions relating the sides and angles at points A, B, C, and D.

Step 5:
Use the properties of the Circumcircle and the fact that D is the intersection of the angle bisector and the circumcircle to establish that BD = DC (since D is an isogonal conjugate in this specific scenario).

Step 6:
Conclude that AD/CD involves using the derived relationships and symmetry from the circumcircle properties to find a specific ratio.

Step 7:
Calculate the exact value of AD/CD using the previously established relationships and geometrical properties.

These steps guide you through utilizing known geometrical principles and the given conditions to derive the desired ratio AD/CD in the triangle with circumcircle intersections.
### Step
Step 1:
Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to triangle ABC, which states that AD/BD = AC/BC. Use the known lengths of the sides to relate AD and BD.

Step 2:
Since point D is on the circumcircle of triangle ABC and AD is the angle bisector, note the relationship between the arc segments on the circumcircle due to angle bisector properties. Re-examine the proportions involving circumcircle properties. 

Step 3:
Investigate the property AD/BD = AC/BC by expressing BD in terms of known triangle sides. Verify the consistency of these expressions as derived from the Triangle's side ratios.

Step 4:
Explore the use of the Law of Sines in triangle ABD and triangle ACD to help establish relationships involving AD and CD with respect to the conjectured values from known conditions.

Step 5:
From the relationships derived from Step 3 and Step 4, calculate the length of CD using the properties of D on the circumcircle and the established segment ratios.

Step 6:
Determine the ratio AD/CD by plugging in the values calculated from previous steps. Ensure the validity of the result matches geometric properties established by known conditions and theorem applications.
