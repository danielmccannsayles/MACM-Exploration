### Step
Steps:

Step 1:
Identify the corners of the larger square using its side length of 6. The corners are at coordinates (0, 0), (6, 0), (6, 6), and (0, 6).

Step 2:
Understand the positioning of the smaller squares at these corners. Each smaller square has a side length of 2 and is placed at one of these corners, occupying a 2x2 area at each corner.

Step 3:
Place Square ABCD within the larger square so it is centered, shares a vertex with the larger square, and has a side length of 4. Determine the possible coordinates for Point A ensuring that ABCD is offset from each corner to allow crossing the edges of the smaller squares without coinciding.

Step 4:
Determine the range of positions for Point A based on the constraints given (e.g., sharing a vertex with one of the larger square corners and ensuring sides cross smaller squares).

Step 5:
Calculate the possible placements of Point A within the range of the perimeter defined by the constraints, aiming for maximum distance from Point P (6, 0).

Step 6:
Use the distance formula to calculate the distance from each potential position of Point A to Point P (6, 0).

Step 7:
Identify the maximum distance achieved from these calculations. Consider potential for maximum distance occurring when Point A is as far as possible from Point P while still satisfying the constraints.

Step 8:
Verify that the found maximum distance satisfies all the provided conditions regarding the placement and size of Square ABCD.

The maximum possible distance from Point A to Point P arises from following these logical positioning steps, ensuring adherence to constraints described regarding Square ABCD.
