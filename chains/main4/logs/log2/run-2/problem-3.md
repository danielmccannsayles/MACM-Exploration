### Step
Step 1:  
Identify the center of the large square since it coincides with the center of square ABCD. Given the large square's side length of 6, its center is at point C(3, 3).

Step 2:  
Determine the positions of points W, X, Y, and Z. These points form the corners of square ABCD and divide the large square into five regions, as stated. Use the condition that the diagonal WX of square ABCD is equal to 2*√2.

Step 3:  
Recognize that square ABCD is aligned symmetrically within the large square, centered at (3, 3), and its vertices form intersections of the sides of the small squares.

Step 4:  
Since the diagonal WX of square ABCD is 2*√2, use this to calculate the side length of square ABCD. The diagonal of a square with side length s is s√2. Thus, for WX = 2*√2, solve 2*√2 = s√2 to find s = 2.

Step 5:  
Calculate the coordinates of the vertices of square ABCD using its center (3, 3) and its side length 2. The vertices will be (3±1, 3±1), giving points (2, 2), (4, 2), (2, 4), and (4, 4).

Step 6:  
Identify point A as one of the vertices of square ABCD. Without loss of generality, assume A is at (2, 2).

Step 7:  
Identify potential locations for point P within the large square. Since you want the maximum distance from A to P, note that P should be at one of the corners of the large square, maximizing the diagonal distance.

Step 8:  
Calculate the maximum possible distance from point A to point P. The corner of the large square furthest from (2, 2) is (6, 6) or (0, 0), both diagonally opposite to point A.

Step 9:  
Use the distance formula to calculate the distance from (2, 2) to (6, 6) or (0, 0). Determine the maximum distance.

Step 10:  
Verify calculations and review any geometric configurations or assumptions to ensure accuracy.

Conclusion:  
After following these steps, arrive at the maximum possible distance from point A to point P within the constraints of the given conditions.
