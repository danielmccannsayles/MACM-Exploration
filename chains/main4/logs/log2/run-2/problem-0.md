### Step
Step 1:
Note that the sum of the altitudes from point P to the sides of triangle ABC (5 + 6 + 7) is 18, which matches the provided sum of altitudes.

Step 2:
Use the known condition that P is a point inside equilateral triangle ABC where the sum of the perpendicular distances to the sides equals the altitude of the equilateral triangle to infer the altitude of triangle ABC.

Step 3:
Since the altitudes sum up correctly, use the formula for the area of a triangle (Area = 1/2 * base * height) with the known sum of the altitudes to determine base (side length of the equilateral triangle ABC).

Step 4:
Recognizing that all three smaller triangles (formed by altitudes from P to the sides) jointly have an area equivalent to triangle ABC, use the symmetry and properties of an equilateral triangle in conjunction with the formula Area = (side^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4 to calculate the side length.

Step 5:
After determining the side length, calculate the area of triangle ABC using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: Area = (side^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4.
### Step
Steps:

Step 1:
Calculate the side length of the equilateral triangle ABC. Use the relation between total altitudes from the interior point P and the side length of the equilateral triangle. The sum of the altitudes equals \(\text{Altitude total} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times \text{side length}\).

Step 2:
Substitute the known sum of altitudes (18) into the equation from Step 1 to solve for the side length using \(\text{side length} = \frac{2 \times 18}{\sqrt{3}}\).

Step 3:
Once the side length is determined, compute the area of triangle ABC using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: \(\text{Area} = \frac{\text{side}^2 \times \sqrt{3}}{4}\).

Step 4:
Plug in the side length obtained from Step 2 into the area formula to calculate and conclude with the area of triangle ABC.
