### Step
Step 1:
Identify the properties of triangle ABC using the given side lengths and the fact that it's a scalene triangle. Use the side lengths AB = 7, AC = 8, and BC = 9 to confirm it is scalene and not right-angled.

Step 2:
Recognize that point D is on the circumcircle of triangle ABC and is the arc midpoint of arc BC opposite point A. This makes D the midpoint of the major arc BC.

Step 3:
Utilize the fact that line AD bisects angle BAC to understand the implications on the angle measures at D.

Step 4:
Use the given ratio AD/BD = AC/BC, which is a property of angle bisectors in a triangle, to establish a relationship between segments AD and BD.

Step 5:
Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem or relevant properties of the circumcircle and angle bisectors to find the relationship between AD and CD.

Step 6:
Calculate AD/CD using known ratios from the properties of the triangle and the circumcircle.

Step 7:
Verify the computation, ensuring that all steps adhere to the conditions specified (e.g., using the properties of a circumcircle and scalene triangles).
### Step
Steps:

Step 1:
Utilize the known condition that in triangle ABC, AD bisects angle BAC and that point D, which is on the circumcircle, is the midpoint of arc BC that does not contain A.

Step 2:
Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that for angle BAC, the bisector divides the opposite side proportionally to the adjacent sides. Hence, relate AD/BD = AC/BC.

Step 3:
Since AD/BD = AC/BC, substitute the given side lengths to form a ratio: AD/BD = 8/9.

Step 4:
Invoke the property that point D is the arc midpoint of BC opposite to A. This implies that AD is equal to the geometric mean of AB and AC in the circumcircle scenario: AD^2 = AB * AC.

Step 5:
Calculate AD using the relation from step 4: AD^2 = 7 * 8 = 56, therefore AD = √56.

Step 6:
Establish the relationship for CD using the proportionality from step 2 and the condition for the circumcircle. Since CD = √([AB * AC] - (BD)^2), substitute BD from step 3.

Step 7:
Finally, compute AD/CD using the results obtained in steps 5 and 6 to solve for the ratio.

Step 8:
Verify the result by ensuring all steps adhere to the properties provided by the circumcircle and the bisector conditions. Confirm that the solution respects the scalene nature and unique position of point D as the midpoint of the arc BC opposite A.

Objectives:
1. Calculate the value of AD/CD
Steps:
Steps:

Step 1:  
Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to triangle ABC: Since AD bisects angle BAC, the ratio AD/BD should equal AC/BC given by the theorem. Thus, write the expression AD/BD = AC/BC using the values AC = 8 and BC = 9.

Step 2:  
Use the property that point D is the arc midpoint of arc BC opposite point A. This property implies that AD is the angle bisector of angle BAC. Use this information, along with the known ratio from Step 1, for further calculations.

Step 3:  
Since D is on the circumcircle, use circle properties such as power of a point or intersecting chord theorem if applicable to reinforce relationships between segments and circles — though not needed immediately for this specific problem, this might assist indirectly.

Step 4:  
Express BD and CD. Since D is not coincident with any vertices, consider what information involving triangle properties and symmetries of the circle can be applied—for instance, check geometric relationships affecting intersection segments.

Step 5:  
From Step 2 and Step 3 relationships, find the expression or equation involving AD and CD that can be solved using the established ratio and circle properties if necessary.

Step 6:  
Solve for the ratio AD/CD using relationships from previous steps and ensure that any equalities reflect the triangle and circle geometry consistently.

Note: Validate each logical step on geometric principles focusing on angle bisectors and the roles of circumscribed circles. While not all properties might get explicitly utilized within the given constraints, ensure any derived relationships applicable are contextually robust and grounded in triangulated square configurations.
