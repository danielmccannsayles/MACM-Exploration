1. Dakota selects three different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
2. The selected integers are used as the side lengths of a triangle
1. Calculate the probability that the selected integers could be the sides of a triangle
## Mined new conditions from existing (1/3):Unchecked Conditions (1/3)
1. based_on_known_conditions=[1, 2] new_condition='The sum of the two smallest selected integers must be greater than the largest selected integer.' reason='According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must always be greater than the third side. This establishes a fundamental condition for any set of three integers to qualify as sides of a triangle.'
2. based_on_known_conditions=[1] new_condition='The total number of different combinations of selecting three integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is 20.' reason='We need to know how many ways we can choose 3 integers from the set, which can be calculated using combinations: C(6,3) = 20, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations.'
3. based_on_known_conditions=[1, 2] new_condition='The valid combinations for Integer sides are combinations that satisfy the triangle inequality condition determined among the possible 20 combinations.' reason='Using the knowledge of possible combinations and the triangle inequality derived, we can deduce which combinations will satisfy the objective of forming a valid triangle.'

Do we have answer?: True
### Step
Step 1:
List all possible combinations of selecting three different integers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. There are 20 such combinations.

Step 2:
For each combination, order the integers from smallest to largest.

Step 3:
Apply the triangle inequality condition: Check if the sum of the two smallest integers is greater than the largest integer.

Step 4:
Count the number of combinations that satisfy the triangle inequality condition.

Step 5:
Calculate the probability by dividing the number of valid combinations (from Step 4) by the total number of combinations (20).

Step 6:
Express the probability as a fraction, decimal, or percentage as needed.
Approved
