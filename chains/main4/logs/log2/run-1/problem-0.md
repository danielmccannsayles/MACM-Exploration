### Step

Steps:

Step 1:
Verify that the sum of the distances from point P to the sides of triangle ABC equals the altitude of triangle ABC, according to Viviani's Theorem.

Step 2:
Since the altitude of triangle ABC is given as 18, confirm that this matches the sum of distances calculated as 5 + 6 + 7 = 18.

Step 3:
Use the formula for the altitude of an equilateral triangle, altitude = side * √3/2, to calculate the side length of triangle ABC.

Step 4:
Solve for the side length of triangle ABC by rearranging the formula: side = 18 / (√3/2).

Step 5:
Calculate the area of triangle ABC using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: area = (side^2 * √3) / 4.

Step 6:
Use the side length obtained from Step 4 to calculate the area based on the formula from Step 5.
### Step
Step 1:
Verify from the known conditions that triangle ABC is equilateral by confirming that the sum of the distances from point P to each side (18) corresponds with the altitude of the triangle (18), as stated in Viviani's Theorem.

Step 2:
