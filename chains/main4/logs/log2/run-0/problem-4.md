1. based_on_known_conditions=[1] new_condition='The sum of any two integers must be greater than the third integer for the triangle inequality theorem to hold.' reason='To form a triangle, the triangle inequality theorem must be satisfied, which states that for any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.'
2. based_on_known_conditions=[0, 1] new_condition='All permutations of a, b, and c are considered, such that 1 <= a < b < c <= 6, ensuring each side is distinct and within the range.' reason='Given that a, b, and c are distinct integers within a specified range, there is a limited set of permutations that need to be checked against the triangle inequality theorem.'
3. based_on_known_conditions=[0, 1] new_condition='The maximum possible value for c is the minimum of 6 and the sum of a and b minus 1.' reason='Since c must be less than the sum of the other two sides to form a triangle, there is a natural upper limit on the value of c based on a and b.'
Verifying condition #1
Verified
The sum of any two integers must be greater than the third integer for the triangle inequality theorem to hold.
Verifying condition #2
Verified
All permutations of a, b, and c are considered, such that 1 <= a < b < c <= 6, ensuring each side is distinct and within the range.
Verifying condition #3
Verified
The maximum possible value for c is the minimum of 6 and the sum of a and b minus 1.
All Conditions: 
1. Dakota selects three different integers, a, b, and c, each ranging from 1 to 6
2. Integers a, b, and c represent the sides of a triangle
3. The sum of any two integers must be greater than the third integer for the triangle inequality theorem to hold.
4. All permutations of a, b, and c are considered, such that 1 <= a < b < c <= 6, ensuring each side is distinct and within the range.
5. The maximum possible value for c is the minimum of 6 and the sum of a and b minus 1.
Do we have answer?: True
### Step
Step 1:
Identify all possible combinations of integers a, b, and c such that 1 ≤ a < b < c ≤ 6.

Step 2:
List all combinations of integers a, b, and c that satisfy the condition 1 ≤ a < b < c ≤ 6. For example, (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), etc.

Step 3:
Apply the triangle inequality theorem to each combination: check if a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a for all listed combinations. 

Step 4:
Count the number of combinations that satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. These combinations are valid triangles.

Step 5:
Calculate the total number of possible combinations of a, b, and c, which is the total number of ways to choose 3 distinct numbers from 6 numbers (i.e., combinations formula C(6, 3)).

Step 6:
Determine the probability that integers a, b, and c can form a triangle by dividing the number of valid combinations (from Step 4) by the total number of combinations (from Step 5).
Approved
