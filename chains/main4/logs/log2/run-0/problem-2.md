### Step

Steps:

Step 1:
Utilize the angle bisector theorem which states \(\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{BD}{DC}\). Given \(AB = 7\) and \(AC = 8\), set up the proportion \(\frac{7}{8} = \frac{BD}{DC}\).

Step 2:
Express \(BD\) in terms of \(DC\) as \(BD = \frac{7}{8} \times DC\).

Step 3:
Using harmonic division properties, recognize that \(D\) and \(A\) divide \(BC\) harmonically. This implies that \(BD \times DC = AB \times AC - AD^2\).

Step 4:
Substitute \(BD = \frac{7}{8} \times DC\) into the harmonic division equation \(BD \times DC = AB \times AC - AD^2\) to find a relationship for \(AD^2\).

Step 5:
Calculate or simplify to find \(AD^2\) in terms of known quantities using \(AB = 7\) and \(AC = 8\).

Step 6:
Solve the derived equation involving \(AD^2\) and known segments/sides to find the ratio \(\frac{AD}{CD}\).

Step 7:
Check for additional simplifications and confirm the value of \(\frac{AD}{CD}\) satisfies all known conditions.
### Step
Step 1:
Review the given side lengths of triangle ABC (AB=7, AC=8, BC=9) to establish the initial geometric properties.

Step 2:
Recognize that D is on the circumcircle and AD bisects \(\angle BAC\), which sets up the angle bisector theorem: \(\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{BD}{DC}\).

Step 3:
Using the angle bisector theorem, compute the proportion \(\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{7}{8}\) to establish a relationship between segments BD and DC.

Step 4:
From the proportion \(\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{7}{8}\), express BD in terms of DC, i.e., \(BD = \frac{7}{8} \cdot DC\).

Step 5:
Apply the condition that D lies on the segment BC such that \(BD + DC = BC = 9\), and use this equation in conjunction with the expression from Step 4 to solve for BD and DC.

Step 6:
Once BD and DC are known, calculate the segment ratios desired, focusing on the expression of AD/CD using derived values.

Step 7:
Verify all relationships and proportions to confirm they are consistently derived from recognized geometric theorems, ensuring that AD/CD is accurately expressed in terms of known segment lengths.

Steps:

Steps:

Step 1:  
Identify key triangle and circle properties, using known conditions: triangle ABC with given side lengths and point D on the circumcircle. Recognize that line segment \( \overline{AD} \) is the angle bisector of \( \angle BAC \).

Step 2:  
Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem, setting up the proportion:  
\[
\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{BD}{DC}
\]

Step 3:  
Recognize that D is on the circumcircle and \( \overline{AD} \) bisects \( \angle BAC \), leading to harmonic division of segment BC by points D and A.

Step 4:  
Recall that AD is the external bisector of \( \angle BAC \). Use the relationship:  
\[ 
AD^2 = AB \cdot AC - BD \cdot DC 
\]
For potential insights into the relationship between lengths, especially between AD and DC.

Step 5:  
Explore additional geometric properties or theorems that apply to triangle bisectors and circumcircle properties. Assess any possible use of known theorems such as Ceva’s Theorem, Stewart’s Theorem, or harmonic division properties that pertain to point D.

Step 6:  
Analyze ratios built from steps 2 and 4 for insights into establishing \( \frac{AD}{CD} \). 

Step 7:  
Synthesize findings and geometric properties, verifying through direct geometric reasoning or algebraic manipulations to derive \( \frac{AD}{CD} \), ensuring logical consistency with known conditions.

Step 8:  
Verify calculations and logical steps based on geometric principles, ensuring no assumptions are made without sufficient justification. Apply comprehensive checks across derived ratios and segment relationships.

Step 9:  
Conclude appropriately with the determined value of \( \frac{AD}{CD} \), or specify needed steps or assumptions that lead to a final solution, based on existing geometric principles relevant to the problem.
