## Results
 Problem 0 -> correct correct incorrect 
Problem 1 -> incorrect incorrect incorrect 
Problem 2 -> incorrect correct correct 
Problem 3 -> incorrect incorrect correct
Problem 4 -> correct correct correct

Total: 8 /15 
= >50% :)

Notes:
problem 3 - 6.3, 5.99, 6.
I think problem 3 is really close to working.

Problem 2 - The two that were incorrect were 0.875 instead of 1.67.. not sure why they thought the same. 

The change from main1 to here made problem 4 consistent. Problem 2 went from 0 right to 2. Problem 3 is also close

>50% is pretty good. If I can get it to >61% then I can try running 56. This will give me 10% confidence intervals, which would put it over the paper results :)
