Verify the current step: 
1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify that $P$ is a point inside an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with altitudes from $P$ to $\, \overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ having lengths of 8, 6, and 7 respectively.
   - The task is to find the area of triangle $ABC$.

2. **Use Viviani’s Theorem:**
   - Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the three sides is equal to the height of the triangle.
   - Calculate the sum of the distances: $8 + 6 + 7 = 21$.

3. **Find the Height of Triangle $ABC$:**
   - According to Viviani’s theorem, the height of the entire triangle $ABC$ is equal to this sum, 21.
   - For an equilateral triangle, the height $h$ can also be calculated using $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a$, where $a$ is the side length.
   - Equating $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a = 21$, solve for $a$: $a = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}$.

4. **Calculate the Area of $\triangle ABC$:**
   - The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle can be expressed as $A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2$.
   - Substitute $a = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the area formula:
     $$A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(196 \times 3) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}588 = 147\sqrt{3}. $$>>
