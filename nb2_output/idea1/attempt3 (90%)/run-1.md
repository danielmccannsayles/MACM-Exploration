Verify the current step: 
1. **Utilize Viviani's Theorem**
   - This theorem states that for a point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides of the triangle is constant and equal to the length of the triangle's altitude.
   - For triangle $\triangle ABC$, the sum of the perpendiculars from point $P$ to sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ is $8 + 6 + 7 = 21$. Thus, the altitude of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ is 21.>>

Verify the current step: 
2. **Calculate the side length of the equilateral triangle**
   - The formula for the altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by:
     \[
h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s
     \]
   - From this, the side length $s$ of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ can be calculated as:
     \[
s = \frac{2h}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2 \times 21}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}

3. **Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle**
   - The formula to calculate the area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is:
     \[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
