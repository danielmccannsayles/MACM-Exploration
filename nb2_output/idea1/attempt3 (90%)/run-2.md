Step 1:
Identify the critical tool or theorem: Recall Viviani's Theorem which states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of an equilateral triangle is constant. This sum is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle.
Step 2:
Calculate the sum of the altitudes from point $P$: Add the given perpendicular distances from point $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$, i.e., 8 + 6 + 7 = 21.
Step 3:
Identify the altitude of triangle $ABC$: Realize that according to Viviani's Theorem, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any point inside an equilateral triangle to its sides (8 + 6 + 7 = 21) is equal to the altitude of the equilateral triangle.
Step 4:
Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle (or insight from Viviani's Theorem): An equilateral triangle with side length $s$ has an altitude of $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$. Set \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 21\) to solve for $s$. 
  - Algberaically, \(s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}\)
Step 5:
Calculate the area: Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2\). Substitute \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\):
   - \[A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}  (14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}  \times 588 = 147\sqrt{3}.\]>> 
And our Final Answer
147\sqrt{3}
