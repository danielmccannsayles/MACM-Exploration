Only 1 wrong..

6: This is a weird one. The verify triggers kind of incorrectly on the first step, 
and then the fixed step tries to solve the whole problem, and gets 147. Then we regenerate steps, and it
only regenerates another step and some empty steps.. Funny that it generates empty steps!
Solution for this is probably to split up the steps. It's fine to have the verify overly trigger happy.
What should have happened is the massive first step should get split up. We also may want to give the fix 
more specific instructions to not add extra ideas.


Wow! 5 times we fixed a current step for reasoning. Interesting..
