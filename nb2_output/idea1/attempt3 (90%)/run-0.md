Verify the current step: 
Given an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with area $A_{\triangle ABC}$ and a point $P$ inside it, the sum of the signed distances from $P$ to each side is zero. This can be represented as:   \[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 0 \] where $d_1, d_2, d_3$ are the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ respectively.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The statement in the current step is incorrect. For a point $P$ inside an equilateral triangle $ABC$, the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to each side of the triangle is not zero. Instead, Viviani's theorem states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from an internal point in an equilateral triangle to the sides of the triangle is equal to the altitude of the triangle. That is for an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the expression would actually be:

\[
 d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = h 
\]

Here, \( h \) is the height of the equilateral triangle, calculated as \( h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \).

Therefore, the statement in the current step is based on a misunderstanding. It should correctly reflect Viviani's theorem, rather than asserting that the sum of distances is zero.>> 
#Fixed step: Given an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with area $A_{\triangle ABC}$ and a point $P$ inside it, Viviani's theorem states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides of the triangle is equal to the altitude of the triangle. These distances are 8, 6, and 7 respectively for sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$. Therefore, the sum of these distances is:

\[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \]

Since this sum is equal to the altitude of the equilateral triangle, the altitude can be used to find the area. Thus, the area of triangle $ABC$ can be calculated using the altitude and side length.>>

Step 1:
Given an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with area $A_{\triangle ABC}$ and a point $P$ inside it, Viviani's theorem states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides of the triangle is equal to the altitude of the triangle. These distances are 8, 6, and 7 respectively for sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$. Therefore, the sum of these distances is:

\[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \]

Since this sum is equal to the altitude of the equilateral triangle, the altitude can be used to find the area. Thus, the area of triangle $ABC$ can be calculated using the altitude and side length.
Step 2:
**Step 2:** Calculate the side length `s` of the equilateral triangle.

The altitude `h` of an equilateral triangle of side length `s` can be expressed in terms of the side length by the formula:
\[
 h = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2} = 21 
\]
Solving for `s`, you find:
\[
 s = \frac{2 \times 21}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}
\]
Step 3:
**Step 3:** Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle using the side length.

The area `A` of an equilateral triangle in terms of its side length `s` is given by:
\[
 A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]
Plug in the side `s = 14\sqrt{3}`:
\[
 A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot 196 \cdot 3 = 147 \sqrt{3} \text{ square units}.
\]>> 
And our Final Answer
147\sqrt{3}
