Verify the current step: 
1. **Identify the Altitude Property:**
   - In any triangle, the sum of distances from a point within the triangle to its sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
   - For equilateral triangles, all three altitudes are equal. Therefore, the sum of the altitudes from point $P$ (which are 8, 6, and 7) must equal the altitude of triangle ABC. This implies: \[
   h = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21
   \]
   where $h$ is the total length of the altitudes from $P$ to the sides of $\triangle ABC$.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: In an equilateral triangle, it is indeed true that you can draw three altitudes, each one being equal due to the properties of the triangle.

However, the statement made in the current step, specifically: "the sum of distances from a point within the triangle to its sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle," is incorrect. 

The actual relation, given Levi's Theorem or sometimes called Viviani's Theorem for equilateral triangles, states that the **sum of the perpendicular distances from an interior point to the sides of an equilateral triangle is equal to the altitude of the triangle**.

- **Point of Error**: The step assumes that the sum of these specific distances (8, 6, and 7) is equal to the altitude $h$ of the entire equilateral triangle.

- **Correction**: While it is indeed logical to sum 8, 6, and 7, the conclusion that this equals the altitude of triangle $ABC$ (21) is only correct due to Viviani's theorem. The explanation that follows for concluding this is misleading or incomplete when saying, "Therefore, sum of the altitudes from point $P$ (which are 8, 6, and 7) must equal the altitude of triangle ABC."

In simpler terms: the conclusion is correct under the right theorem, but the reasoning is flawed or missing complete grounding in theory.>> 
#Fixed step: 1. **Identify the Altitude Property:**
   - The sum of the perpendicular distances from a point within an equilateral triangle to its sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
   - Thus, for point $P$ inside $\triangle ABC$ with distances 8, 6, and 7 to sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ respectively, we conclude: \[
   h = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21
