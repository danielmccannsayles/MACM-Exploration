Step by step is idea 1 in notebook 2.

Note that all 3 attempts are the same configuration. It's only chance that they happen to increase in percentage correct.
This is a reminder that the variance of LLMs is very high.

Notes taken from all of them:

Attempt 1:
- 3/10 total failed. Two failed at a math error. One failed because it stopped too early (missed a step)

Attempt 2:
- 4/20 total failed. Three of them needed more steps, to actually solve the problem. One of them regenerated steps and only made two steps, with one of them being massive and slightly off.

Attempt 3:
- 1/10 total failed. Weird one. The fix step created a monstrous step

So 8/40 wrong, 80% accuracy (n=40). Not bad, but hard to be conclusive w/ the LLM variance.
