Starting run #2
Verify the current step: 
Identify the expression for the area of triangle $ABC$ from the altitudes: In any triangle, the area is half the product of its base and corresponding altitude. Similarly, equilateral triangle area expression can be derived based on portions using the altitudes from internal point $P$.
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
Consider that the area of triangle $ABC$ could be approached as the sum of the smaller triangles formed by point $P$: Use the given altitudes 8, 6, and 7 from point $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ respectively to set up three expressions: \[ \text{Area}(\triangle PAB) = \frac{1}{2} \, \overline{AB} \, \text{x} \, 8, \\\text{Area}(\triangle PBC) = \frac{1}{2} \, \overline{BC} \, \text{x} \, 6, \\\text{Area}(\triangle PCA) = \frac{1}{2} \, \overline{CA} \, \text{x} \, 7 \].
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
Utilize Viviani's Theorem: Since $P$ is any point inside equilateral $\triangle ABC$, the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides of the triangle equals the altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Therefore, the altitude $h_{ABC} = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21$.
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
Compute the area of $\triangle ABC$: To find the full area, use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, which is \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{side} \times \text{altitude}. \) Given the altitude $h_{ABC} = 21$, and knowing in an equilateral triangle the relationship between side length ($s$) and altitude ($h$) is $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s$, you can solve for $s$ and back-substitute to find area.
