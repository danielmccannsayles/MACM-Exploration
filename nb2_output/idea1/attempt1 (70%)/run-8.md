Verify the current step: 
**Step 1: Understanding Viviani's Theorem**  
- Recall that Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances to the three sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.  
- In mathematical terms, if the point P has perpendicular distances of d1, d2, and d3 to the sides of triangle ABC, then:  
  \[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = \text{altitude of } \triangle ABC \]
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
**Step 2: Calculate the sum of the given altitudes from point P**  
- The given distances from point P to the sides of triangle ABC are:  
  d1 = 8, d2 = 6, and d3 = 7  
- Compute the sum:  
  \[ \text{Sum} = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \]
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
**Step 3: Calculate the altitude of triangle ABC**  
- From Step 2 and Viviani's Theorem, we deduce the triangle's altitude is 21.  
- Let s be the side length of triangle ABC, and use the relationship between the sides and altitude in an equilateral triangle:  
  \[ \text{altitude} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]  
  \[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]  
  \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14 \sqrt{3} \]
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
**Step 4: Calculate the area of triangle ABC**  
- Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:  
  \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]  
- Substitute the calculated side length:  
  \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14 \sqrt{3})^2 \]  
  \[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3 \]  
  \[ = 147 \sqrt{3} \]
