Verify the current step: 
Let the side length of equilateral triangle $ABC$ be $s$. In an equilateral triangle, the area $A$ can be given by:
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\]
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
The area of triangle $ABC$ can also be expressed using the altitudes from point $P$.
If $d_a$, $d_b$, and $d_c$ are the distances from point $P$ to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ respectively, the area $A$ can be written as:
\[ A = \frac{s(d_a + d_b + d_c)}{2} \]
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
Plug in the given values:
Let $d_a = 8$, $d_b = 6$, and $d_c = 7$. Thus, the area $A$ becomes:
\[ A = \frac{s(8 + 6 + 7)}{2} = \frac{21s}{2} \]
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
Equate the two expressions for area:
\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \frac{21s}{2} \]
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
Cancel out $s$ (for $s \neq 0$) and solve the equation:
\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s = \frac{21}{2} \]
Multiply both sides by 4 to isolate $s$:
\[ \sqrt{3}s = 42 \] 
Divide by $\sqrt{3}$:
\[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \]
Substitute $s$ back into the original area formula:
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
