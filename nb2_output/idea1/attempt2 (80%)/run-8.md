Verify the current step: 


3. **Determine the Side of the Triangle**: The altitude \(h\) of an equilateral triangle in terms of side \(s\) is given by the formula \(h = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Using this formula, solve for side \(s\) using \(h = 21\):
   \[ 21 = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2} \]
   \[ s\sqrt{3} = 42 \]

4. **Find the Area of the Triangle**: The area of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula \(A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\). Substitute \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \) into the formula:
   \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
   \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
   \[ A = \frac{1764\sqrt{3}}{4} \]
   \[ A = 441\sqrt{3} \]>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: To verify the correctness of the current step, let's break it down:

### Step Analysis:

1. **Formula Used**: The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is given by:
   
   \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
   
2. **Substitution**: We know from previous steps that \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \). Substituting this into the area formula gives:

   \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]

3. **Simplify the Expression**:
   - First, calculate \((14\sqrt{3})^2\):
     
     \[(14\sqrt{3})^2 = 14^2 \times (\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588\]
   
   - Substitute back into the area expression:
   
     \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]

4. **Further Simplification**:
   - Simplify \( \frac{588}{4} \):
     
     \[ \frac{588}{4} = 147 \]

   - Thus, the area becomes:
   
     \[ A = 147\sqrt{3} \]

### Conclusion:
  - The current step calculates \( A = 441\sqrt{3} \), which suggests a computation error.
  - Correct calculation shows \( A = 147\sqrt{3} \).

### Verification Result:
The calculation in the current step is incorrect due to a mistake in simplifying the area expression.>>
