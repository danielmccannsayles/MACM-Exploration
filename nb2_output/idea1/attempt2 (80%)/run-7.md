Verify the current step: 
**1. Understand the given conditions and construct an approach based on Viviani’s Theorem:**
   - Given an equilateral triangle $ABC$, point $P$ is inside the triangle.
   - The problem specifies altitudes/dropped perpendiculars from point $P$ to each side: 8 to $\overline{AB}$, 6 to $\overline{BC}$, and 7 to $\overline{CA}$.
   - According to Viviani's Theorem, the sum of the distances from an interior point to the sides of an equilateral triangle equals the altitude of the triangle.
   - Calculate the total of the given perpendiculars: $8 + 6 + 7 = 21$. This sum is the altitude of the triangle $ABC$.>>

Verify the current step: 
**2. Use the altitude to find side length of the equilateral triangle:**
   - The altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by the formula: 
     \[
h = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2}.
     \]
   - Substituting $h = 21$ (from step 1): 
     \[
21 = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2}
     \]
     \[
s = \frac{2 \times 21}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}.

Verify the current step: 
**3. Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:**
   - The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by:
     \[
A = \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}.
     \]
   - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ (from step 2):
     \[
A = \frac{(14\sqrt{3})^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{196 \times 3 \times \sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3}.
