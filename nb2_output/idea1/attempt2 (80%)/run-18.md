Verify the current step: 
1. **Understand the context and theorem**: Recognize that this problem involves Viviani's Theorem, which states that for any point $P$ inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the three sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
2. **Apply Viviani's Theorem**: For triangle $ABC$ with point $P$ inside:
   - Let the side of the equilateral triangle be $s$.
   - The altitude of triangle $ABC$ is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$. According to Viviani's Theorem, the sum of the altitudes from $P$ is equal to this altitude.
   - Therefore, $8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s \Rightarrow 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
3. **Solve for side length $s$ of the triangle**:
   - From: $21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate $s$: $42 = \sqrt{3}s$
   - Divide both sides by $\sqrt{3}$ to find $s$: 
   $$s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}$$>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
4. **Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle $ABC$**:
   - The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by $A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$.
   - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the formula:
   $$A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2$$
   $$= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14^2 \times 3)$$
   $$= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(588)$$
   $$= \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4}$$
   $$= 147\sqrt{3}$$>>
