Verify the current step: 
1. **Use Viviani's Theorem for Equilateral Triangles:**
   - In any equilateral triangle with a point inside, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the three sides is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle. In this problem, \(8 + 6 + 7 = 21\) corresponds to the altitude of triangle \(ABC\).>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
2. **Calculate the side length using the altitude:**
   - The altitude \(h\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by the formula \( h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s \).
   - Set \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 21\) and solve for \(s\):
     \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 21 \]
     \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]
     \[ s = 14\sqrt{3} \]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
3. **Calculate the area of the triangle ABC:**
   - The area \(A\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by the formula \( A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 \).
   - Substitute \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\) into the formula:
     \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
     \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3 \]
     \[ A = 147\sqrt{3} \].>>
