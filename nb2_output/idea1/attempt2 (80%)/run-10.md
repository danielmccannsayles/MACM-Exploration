Verify the current step: 
1. **Use Viviani's Theorem**: Recognize that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of an equilateral triangle is equal to the altitude of the triangle. Thus:

   \[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = h \]
   where \(d_1 = 8, d_2 = 6, d_3 = 7\). So,
   \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = h \]
   \[ h = 21 \]

2. **Find the side length of the triangle using the altitude**: For an equilateral triangle, the relationship between side length \(s\) and altitude \(h\) is given by:

   \[ h = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \]
   Rearrange to find \(s\):

   \[ s = \frac{2h}{\sqrt{3}} \]
   Substitute \(h = 21\):

   \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14 \sqrt{3} \]

3. **Calculate the area of triangle \(ABC\)**: The area \(A\) of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using its side length \(s\):

   \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
   Substitute \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\):

   \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
   \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
   \[ A = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} \]
   \[ A = 147\sqrt{3} \].>>
