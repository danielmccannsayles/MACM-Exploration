Verify the current step: 
1. Understand Viviani's Theorem:
   - Viviani's theorem states that for any point P inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from P to the sides of the triangle is equal to the altitude of the triangle.

Verify the current step: 
2. Apply Viviani's Theorem:
   - Given that the distances from P to the sides AB, BC, and CA are 8, 6, and 7 respectively, the sum of these distances is 8 + 6 + 7 = 21.

Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
4. Use the Formula for Area of an Equilateral Triangle:
   - The area A of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by the formula \( A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \).
   - The altitude (h) can also be expressed in terms of s as \( h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \).

5. Calculate the Area:
   - Solve for s: Set \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21 \) and solve for s.
   - Compute the area \( A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \) using the value of s obtained in the previous step.>>
