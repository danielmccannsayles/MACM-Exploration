Verify the current step: 
1. **Understand the Medial Triangle Approach:**\n   - Since $P$ is inside the equilateral triangle $ABC$ with given altitudes from $P$ to each side, these points where the perpendiculars meet the sides form what is known as the "medial triangle" of $P$.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step introduces the concept of a "medial triangle," which is a triangle formed by connecting the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from a point within a larger triangle to its sides. 

However, the term "medial triangle" is misleading here. A medial triangle traditionally refers to a triangle formed by the midpoints of the sides of another triangle, not by the feet of perpendiculars from a point inside the triangle.

The correct approach for this problem involves using Viviani's Theorem, which states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances to the sides is constant and equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle. In this problem, it would help determine the area of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Thus, referring to the configuration formed by the altitudes from point $P$ as a medial triangle is incorrect.
