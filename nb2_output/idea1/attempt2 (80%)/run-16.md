Verify the current step: 
1. **Understanding of the Problem:** The problem involves an equilateral triangle $ABC$, with a point $P$ inside it such that the lengths of the perpendiculars (altitudes) from $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ are 8, 6, and 7 respectively. We aim to find the area of triangle $ABC$.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
2. **Use Viviani's Theorem:** This geometric theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the three sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle. Therefore, add the given altitudes (8, 6, and 7) to find the altitude $h$ of triangle $ABC$. 
   
   \[8 + 6 + 7 = h = 21 \]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
3. **Calculate the Area of the Equilateral Triangle:** The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is:
   \[ 
   \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (\text{Side})^2
   \]
   However, if instead you use \[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Side} \times \text{Altitude} \] where you know the altitude $h = 21$, then \[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times 21 \] and you know that the side $s$ relates directly to the altitude for an equilateral triangle by \[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \].>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
4. **Solve for the Side Length $s$: ** Use \[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \] to solve for $s$.
   \[
   s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}
   \]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
5. **Find the Area Using Calculated Side:**
   Substitute back to find the area with \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot (14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
   Simplify this expression:
   \[ 147\sqrt{3} \]>>
