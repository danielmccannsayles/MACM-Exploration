Verify the current step: 
1. **Apply Viviani’s Theorem**: 
   - Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to each side of the triangle is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
   - Here, we have the distances from point $P$ to each side, which are 8, 6, and 7.
   - Calculate the sum: $8 + 6 + 7 = 21$. Thus, the altitude of triangle $ABC$ is 21.

2. **Express the altitude in terms of the side length $s$**:
   - For an equilateral triangle, the altitude is given by: $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$.
   - Set this equal to the calculated altitude: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 21$.

3. **Solve for $s$, the side length of triangle $ABC$**:
   - Rearrange the expression from the previous step: $s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}}$.
   - Simplify: $s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}$.

4. **Calculate the area of triangle $ABC$**:
   - The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle in terms of its side length $s$ is given by: $A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$.
   - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the formula:
     - $A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2$
     - $A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(196 \times 3)$
     - $A = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4}$
     - $A = 147\sqrt{3}$.>>
