Verify the current step: 
Calculate the total sum of the altitudes from point $P$ to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$. In this case, the lengths are 8, 6, and 7, respectively, so the total is 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 units.>>

Verify the current step: 
Apply the Viviani's Theorem, which states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances to the sides is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle. Thus, the length of an altitude of triangle $ABC$ is 21 units.>>

Verify the current step: 
Use the formula for the altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side length $s$, given by $h = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Since the altitude $h$ is 21, substitution in the formula yields $21 = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Solve this equation for $s$ to find $s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}$. Simplify $s$ to get $s = 14\sqrt{3}$.>>

Verify the current step: 
Calculate the area of triangle $ABC$ using the side length $s$. For an equilateral triangle, the area $A$ is given by $A = \frac{s^2\sqrt{3}}{4}$. Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:>>

Verify the current step: 
$A = \frac{(14\sqrt{3})^2\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{196 \cdot 3\sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3}$. So the area of triangle $ABC$ is $147\sqrt{3}$ square units.>>
