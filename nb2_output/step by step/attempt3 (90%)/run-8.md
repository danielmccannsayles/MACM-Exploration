Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step involves calculating the area of an equilateral triangle using the formula 

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times s^2 \]

where \( s \) is the side length. Given that in the previous step, the side length \( s \) was found to be \( 14\sqrt{3} \), this formula will be used to calculate the area.

Let's verify the calculations:

1. **Square the side length \( s \):**
   - \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \)
   - \( s^2 = (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588 \)

2. **Plug \( s^2 \) into the area formula:**
   - \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]

3. **Simplify the expression for the area:**
   - \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \times 588}{4} \]
   - \[ \frac{588}{4} = 147 \text{ (since \( {588}/{4} = 147 \))}\]
   - \[ \text{Area} = \sqrt{3} \times 147 \]
   - \[ \text{Area} = 147\sqrt{3} \]

The last line showed the calculation should include a factor of \( \sqrt{3} \) multiplied with 147 based on the simplification of the area formula, but the current step incorrectly concluded the area as just 147, missing this final multiplication.

Therefore, the correct final step should stop at \( \text{Area} = 147\sqrt{3} \).>>

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \times 588}{4} \]
