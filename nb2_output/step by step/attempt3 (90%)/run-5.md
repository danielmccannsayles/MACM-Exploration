Verify the current step: 
1. **Understand the Problem: Geometry Interpretation**  
Recognize that you are dealing with an equilateral triangle $ABC$, and point $P$ is located inside it with specific projected altitudes from $P$ onto the triangle's sides. Ensure you understand that altitudes in this context are perpendicular segments from point $P$ to the sides of the triangle, not necessarily vertices.>>

Verify the current step: 
2. **Apply Viviani's Theorem**  
Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides is equal to the length of the altitude of the equilateral triangle.  
- Calculate the sum of given altitudes: 
  \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \] 
- This implies that the altitude of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ is also 21.

3. **Relate Triangle's Altitude to Its Side Length**  
For an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \), the altitude \( h \) is given by the formula:
\[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]  
- Setting \( h = 21 \) and solving for \( s \):
  \[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]  
- Solving for \( s \):
  \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \]>>

Verify the current step: 
4. **Calculate the Area of Equilateral Triangle $ABC$**  
Having the side length \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \), the area \( A \) of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula: 
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]  
- Plug in the side length: 
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]  
- Calculate the area step-by-step:
  - First, evaluate \((14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588\)
  - Then calculate the area: 
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = 147\sqrt{3} \]>>
