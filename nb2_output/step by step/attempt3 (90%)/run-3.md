Verify the current step: 
1. **Understanding the Medial Triangle Set-Up**:
   - In an equilateral triangle $ABC$, when a point $P$ is inside the triangle, the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides of $	riangle ABC$ are known as the 'altitudes' and can help form a smaller, internal triangle known as the 'medial triangle'. This smaller triangle would have its vertices on the edges of $	riangle ABC$.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step refers to the concept of distances from an internal point $P$ to the sides of an equilateral triangle $ABC$ and the notion of a 'medial triangle'. However, it seems to describe a misunderstanding or misuse of terminology and geometry concepts:

1. **Medial Triangle Misunderstanding**:
   - The medial triangle of a given triangle is formed by connecting the midpoints of each side of the original triangle, not by connecting points defined by perpendicular distances to the sides.
   - The described situation involves perpendicular distances from a point $P$ within the triangle to its sides, which doesn't directly form a medial triangle. Instead, it defines three segments that are altitudes of a smaller triangle formed by points on each side.

2. **Application to the Given Problem**:
   - While the concept of perpendicular distances is correct for determining elements of a smaller, internal triangle, the term 'medial triangle' used here is misleading for the problem context.
   - The primary concept to apply might be Viviani's Theorem for equilateral triangles, or another geometric strategy, but not the concept or construction of a 'medial triangle'.

In summary, the description of the concept in the current step uses incorrect terminology and does not align with the geometric configuration required to solve the problem. Therefore, the current step is not properly applicable to the problem.
