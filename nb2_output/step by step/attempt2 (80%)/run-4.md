Verify the current step: 
1. **Understand the Geometric Setup**:
   - You have an equilateral triangle $ABC$. Inside $ABC$, there is a point $P$ with perpendicular distances to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ given as 8, 6, and 7, respectively. Importantly, these perpendiculars are essentially the altitudes from $P$ to the sides of the triangle $ABC$.>>

Verify the current step: 
2. **Apply Viviani's Theorem**:
   - Viviani's theorem states that in an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides equals the length of the altitudes of the triangle.
   - In this problem, the perpendicular distances from $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ are 8, 6, and 7. According to Viviani's theorem: 
     \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = h \]
   - This gives us the altitude $h = 21$.>>

Verify the current step: 
3. **Relate the Altitude to the Side Length of Triangle $ABC$**:
   - The altitude $h$ in an equilateral triangle is related to the side length $s$ by the formula: 
     \[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]
   - Using this equation, solve for $s$, the side length of the triangle. 
     \[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]
     \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
4. **Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**:
   - The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle in terms of the side length $s$ is given by: 
     \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
   - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the formula:
     \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
     \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (196 \cdot 3) \]
     \[ A = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} \]
     \[ A = 147\sqrt{3} \]>>
