Verify the current step: 
**1. Use Area Formula for Triangle with Internal Point**: When a point $P$ is inside an equilateral triangle with altitudes $d_a$, $d_b$, and $d_c$ from P to the sides AB, BC, and CA, the area of the triangle is $\frac{s(d_a + d_b + d_c)}{2}$, where $s$ is the side length of the triangle.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step attempts to apply a formula for calculating the area of an equilateral triangle based on a point inside it and the perpendicular distances to its sides. However, this formula is not standard or correct for determining the area of an equilateral triangle using given distances from an inner point to its sides.

### Understanding the Standard Approach
The correct approach to find the area of $\triangle ABC$ when a point $P$ inside it projects altitudes to the sides is to apply Viviani's Theorem or use the property involving internal or external point in an equilateral triangle.

#### Viviani's Theorem states:
The sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of an equilateral triangle is equal to the altitude of the triangle.

1. **Calculate Altitude of the Equilateral Triangle**:
   - If the sum of the distances from the internal point $P$ (8 + 6 + 7 = 21) represents the triangle's altitude, then:
   - The formula for altitude $h$ in terms of side length $s$ for an equilateral triangle is: \[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \].
   - Set the altitude to 21 and solve for $s$:
     \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21 \].
   - Solving for $s$: \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \].

2. **Calculate Area of $\triangle ABC$**:
   - The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle in terms of its side length $s$ is: \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \].
   - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the area formula.

#### Conclusion
The suggested formula in the current step, $\frac{s(d_a + d_b + d_c)}{2}$, does not align with standard geometrical results applicable to equilateral triangles.

Therefore, the current step applying this formula is incorrect.>>
