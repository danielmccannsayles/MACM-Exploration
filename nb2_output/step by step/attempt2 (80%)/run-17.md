Verify the current step: 
1. **Understand Viviani's Theorem**:
   - Recognize that Viviani’s theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances to the three sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
   - Given that $P$ is inside triangle $ABC$, we know that the sum of altitudes from $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ should equal the altitude of triangle $ABC$.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
2. **Calculate the Sum of Distances**:
   - Add the lengths of the perpendiculars from $P$: $8 + 6 + 7 = 21$. 
   - According to Viviani's Theorem, this sum (21) is also the altitude from a vertex to the opposite side in triangle $ABC$.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
3. **Relate Altitude to Side Length**:
   - In an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the altitude $h$ is given by the formula: 
   $$ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \, s $$
   - Substitute $h = 21$ into the equation:
   $$ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \, s $$
   - Solve for $s$:
   $$ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} $$>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
4. **Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**:
   - The area of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula:
   $$ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \, s^2 $$
   - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the equation:
   $$ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \, (14\sqrt{3})^2 $$
   - Proceed to calculate:
   $$ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \, (196 \times 3) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \, 588 = 147 \sqrt{3} $$>>
