Verify the current step: 
1. **Introduction of the Key Formula:**
   - We utilize Viviani’s Theorem for equilateral triangles, which states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any point inside an equilateral triangle to its sides is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle.
   - This can be expressed as: \[ h_A + h_B + h_C = \text{altitude of } \triangle ABC \] where \( h_A, h_B, h_C \) are the perpendicular distances from point \(P\) to sides \(\overline{AB}, \overline{BC},\) and \( \overline{CA} \) respectively.

2. **Calculate the Altitude of Equilateral Triangle \(\triangle ABC\):**
   - According to Viviani’s Theorem: \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \]
   - Find the altitude \( h \) of the equilateral triangle \(\triangle ABC = 21 \). 

3. **Express the Area of \(\triangle ABC\) in Terms of its Side Length \( s \):**
   - The altitude \( h \) of an equilateral triangle is \( h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s \).
   - We equate this to our calculated altitude: \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s = 21 \]
   - Solve for \( s \): \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]
   - Simplify the side length: \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \). 

4. **Find the Area of \(\triangle ABC\):**
   - The area \( A \) of an equilateral triangle is given by \[ A = \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} \].
   - Substitute \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \):
   - \[ A = \frac{(14\sqrt{3})^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} \]
   - Simplifying gives \[ A = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4} \].

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Reduce the expression to find the area: \[ A = 147 \sqrt{3} \].
   - So, the area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is \( 147 \sqrt{3} \).>>
