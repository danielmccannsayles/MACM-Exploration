Verify the current step: 
Use the formula for the area of a triangle based on the perpendicular distances from a point inside the triangle to its sides: 

\[ Area_{ABC} = \frac{s}{2} (h_1 + h_2 + h_3) \] 

where \( s \) is the side length of the equilateral triangle, and \( h_1, h_2, h_3 \) are the perpendicular distances from point \( P \) to sides \( \overline{AB} \), \( \overline{BC} \), and \( \overline{CA} \) respectively (here they are 8, 6, and 7).>>

Verify the current step: 
Know that for an equilateral triangle, the area can also be expressed as:

\[ Area_{equilateral} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
To find the side length \( s \), set the two expressions for area equal to each other:

\[ \frac{s}{2} (8 + 6 + 7) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
Simplify and solve for \( s \). First simplify the left-hand side:

\[ \frac{s}{2} \times 21 = 10.5s \]

Set this equal to the right-hand side:

\[ 10.5s = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
Divide both sides by \( s \) (assuming \( s \neq 0 \)):

\[ 10.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s \] 

Solve for \( s \):

\[ s = \frac{10.5 \times 4}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Once you find \( s \), use it to calculate the area using either formula.>>
