Verify the current step: 
1. **Understand Viviani's Theorem**: This problem revolves around Viviani's Theorem, which states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any internal point to the sides of an equilateral triangle is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
   
2. **Set Up the Equation Using Viviani's Theorem**: Since the point P is inside the equilateral triangle ABC, apply Viviani's theorem to set up the equation for the sum of the altitudes:
   \[ h_{AB} + h_{BC} + h_{CA} = h \]
   Where \( h = \) altitude of triangle ABC, and \( h_{AB} = 8 \), \( h_{BC} = 6 \), \( h_{CA} = 7 \).

3. **Calculate the Altitude of Triangle ABC**: Using the information, calculate the altitude h of triangle ABC:
   \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = h \]
   \[ h = 21 \]
   
4. **Express Area of Triangle ABC in Terms of Altitude**: Once the altitude is known, use the formula for the area \( A \) of an equilateral triangle which is expressed in terms of altitude:
   \[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{altitude} \]
   Let the side of the triangle be s.
   The altitude \( h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot s \), hence, \( s = \frac{2h}{\sqrt{3}} \). 

5. **Find the Area Using Known Altitude**: Substitute the altitude into the area formula to find:
   \[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times 21 \]
   \[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2 \times 21}{\sqrt{3}} \times 21 \]
   \[ A = \frac{441}{\sqrt{3}} \]
   \[ A = 147 \sqrt{3} \]
   
   Simplifying, you find the area to be expressed as a rational number if possible. However, \( A = 147 \sqrt{3} \), which represents the area of triangle ABC.>>
