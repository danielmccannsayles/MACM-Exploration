Verify the current step: 
1. **Identify the Area Formula**: Recognize that the distance from point $P$ inside equilateral triangle $ABC$ to the sides can be used to find the area of the triangle. By the formula \( A = \frac{1}{2}(a+h_1 + b+h_2 + c+h_3) \) where \( h_1, h_2, h_3 \) are the perpendicular distances, and \( a, b, c \) are the respective lengths of the sides, the area is calculated as a combination of these perpendiculars and the circum-circle radius.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step introduces an incorrect formula for determining the area of the equilateral triangle based on the given altitudes from point $P$ to the triangle's sides. 

**What the Problem Requires:**
- The problem involves finding the area of equilateral triangle $ABC$ given the perpendiculars from point $P$ inside.

**Correct Approach Reference:**
- By Viviani's Theorem, for any point $P$ inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to each of the triangle's sides is equal to the altitude of the equilateral triangle.
- Denote the side length of the equilateral triangle as $s$.
- The altitude of the equilateral triangle is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \).
- Therefore, \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21. \]
- Solving for $s$ gives \( s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \), which can be used to find the area.

**Why Current Step is Incorrect:**
- The formula provided in the current step \( A = \frac{1}{2}(a+h_1 + b+h_2 + c+h_3) \) is not a standard formula for an equilateral triangle or any triangle given angles and perpendicular distances.
- The current step's formula does not accurately relate side lengths and the specific distances to the area.

#Fixed step: To determine the area of equilateral triangle $ABC$ with a point $P$ inside it having perpendicular distances 8, 6, and 7 to the sides, we use Viviani's Theorem. The sum of these distances equals the altitude of the equilateral triangle. For side length $s$, the altitude is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s\). Thus, \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21\). Solving for $s$ gives \( s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \). The area of the triangle is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\).>>
