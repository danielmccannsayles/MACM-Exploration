Verify the current step: 
Identify the Given Information: You are given an equilateral triangle ABC and a point P inside it. The altitudes from point P have lengths 8, 6, and 7 units toward sides AB, BC, and CA, respectively.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
Understand the Concept of Viviani’s Theorem: According to Viviani's theorem, in an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of the triangle is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
Calculate the Total Length of Altitudes from P: Apply Viviani’s theorem, knowing that the perimeter of the small triangles formed around P equals the altitude of the large equilateral triangle. Calculate the total sum of perpendicular distances: 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 units.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
Determine the Length of the Altitude of Triangle ABC: Realize that according to Viviani’s theorem, the total length equals the altitude of the equilateral triangle ABC, which is 21.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verify the current step: 
Compute the Area of Triangle ABC: Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle based on its altitude. Given altitude h: 21 = (sqrt(3)/2) * side length (s), solve for s. Calculate the area using A = (s^2 * sqrt(3))/4 once the side length is determined.>>
