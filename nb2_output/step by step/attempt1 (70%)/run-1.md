Verify the current step: 
Recognize that any point $P$ inside an equilateral triangle $ABC$ will satisfy Viviani's theorem. Viviani's theorem states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of an equilateral triangle is constant and equal to the altitude of the triangle.
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
Calculate the altitude of triangle $ABC$. Given the perpendiculars from point $P$ to the sides are 8, 6, and 7, their sum is 21. By Viviani's theorem, this sum should be equal to the altitude of triangle $ABC$. Hence, the altitude of triangle $ABC$ is 21.

Verify the current step: 
Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: $\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2$, where $a$ is the side length. First, solve for $a$ using the relationship between altitude ($h$) and side length for equilateral triangles: $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a$.\n\nSolve for $a$ by equating the altitude to 21:\n\[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a \Longrightarrow a = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}. \]
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
Substitute the value of $a$ back into the area formula:\n\[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{3}{4}(196) = 147. \]
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step involves substituting the found side length $a = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the area formula for an equilateral triangle to find the area of triangle $ABC$.

### Verification:
1. **Substitute for $a$ in the area formula**:  
   The area formula for an equilateral triangle is given by:
   \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 \]
   Substitute $a = 14\sqrt{3}$:
   \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 \]

2. **Expand and calculate the expression**:  
   Expand $(14\sqrt{3})^2$:
   \[ (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 14^2(\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588 \]
   Substitute back into the area expression:
   \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]

3. **Simplify the expression**:  
   Distribute the factors:
   \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = \frac{3 \times 588}{4} \]
   Calculate:
   \[ \frac{1764}{4} = 441 \]

Thus, the calculated area of the triangle is **441**, rather than the given **147**. The steps involved in substituting into the area formula are incorrect.
#Fixed step: Substitute the value of $a$ back into the area formula:\n\[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = 441. \]
