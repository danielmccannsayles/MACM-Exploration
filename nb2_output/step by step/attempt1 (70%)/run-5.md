Starting run #5
Verify the current step: 
1. **Understand the Formula Involved**:
    - Be familiar with Viviani's Theorem which states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances to the three sides is equal to the height of the triangle. 
    - This problem asks for the area of triangle $ABC$, given the distances from point $P$ to each side.

Verify the current step: 
2. **Apply Viviani's Theorem**:
    - Calculate the sum of the altitudes from point $P$:
      \[
      d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21
      \]

Verify the current step: 
3. **Connect Height to Area**:
    - Use the fact that the height of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ can be expressed as \( h = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \). Convert the height to the side of the equilateral triangle:
      \[
      \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} = 21 \\
      s \sqrt{3} = 42 \\
      s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14 \sqrt{3}
      \]

Verify the current step: 
4. **Calculate the Area of $
Triangle ABC$**:
    - Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: 
      \[
      \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 \\
      \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14 \sqrt{3})^2 \\
      = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \\
      = 147 \sqrt{3}
      \]
