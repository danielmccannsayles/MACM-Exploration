Starting run #4
Verify the current step: 
1. **Understand the Formula for Area Contributions**: For point $P$ inside an equilateral triangle $ABC$, the area contribution from $P$ to each side is given by the formula for calculating the area of a triangle using a base and its corresponding height. These contributions can be summed to find the total area of the equilateral triangle. If the altitudes from P to the sides AB, BC, and CA are $h_1$, $h_2$, and $h_3$, respectively, the formula is \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (AB \times h_1 + BC \times h_2 + CA \times h_3) \), where $AB = BC = CA = s$, the side length of the equilateral triangle.

2. **Apply Viviani's Theorem**: According to Viviani's theorem, in an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances (altitudes in this context) from any internal point to the sides of the triangle is equal to the length of the triangle's altitude. Therefore, calculate the triangle's altitude $h = h_1 + h_2 + h_3 = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21$.

3. **Calculate the Side Length of the Triangle**: The altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by the formula $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s$. Rearrange this to find $s$: \( s = \frac{2h}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2 \times 21}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \).

Verify the current step: 
4. **Compute the Area of $\triangle ABC$**: Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, \( \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \). Substitute the value of $s$: \( \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = 147 \).
