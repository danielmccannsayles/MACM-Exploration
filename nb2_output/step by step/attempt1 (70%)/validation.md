## Generated
 The final answer is: The area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is 147.
147√3
The final answer for the area \( A \) is 147.
147
147√3
147√3
\(147 \sqrt{3}\)
147 \sqrt{3}
\( 147\sqrt{3} \) square units.
The final answer is \( 147\sqrt{3} \). 
======
## Actual
 147 * sqrt(3) 


=====
Added manually:
The incorrect ones and their reason was->
0: This one goes wrong when it tries to cancel out s on both sides but s^2 is not handled correctly. So math error.
2: This one failed because it didn't actually get to a final answer. So the get_final_answer did its best but did not have any validation. Can be fixed by at the end, checking if we need anymore steps. And repeatedly making a new step to bridge that gap (w/ verifiying etc.)
4: this one is kinda weird. It came up with the right answer but in step 4 it simplifies it down to 147 instead of 147 sqrt(3). 

Other notes:
- Only 2 of the 10 actually were verified as incorrect. We know that 0 and 4 should have triggered this verification too. 
- We're not actually executing these steps right now. (though I don't think we should. We've already verified them..)

*note: the order is not preserved
