Verify the current step: 
**Step 1:** Identify the relationship from Viviani's Theorem.

According to Viviani's Theorem, for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides of the triangle is equal to the altitude of the triangle.

In our case:
- Total distance: \(8 + 6 + 7 = 21\).
- Set the total distance from Viviani's theorem equal to the altitude of \(\triangle ABC\).
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
**Step 2:** Calculate the altitude of \(\triangle ABC\) using its known side length (let's assume side length = \(s\)).

The formula for the altitude \(h\) of an equilateral triangle in terms of its side length \(s\) is:
\[ h = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2}. \] 

Since the total distance (sum of altitudes) is 21:
\[ \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} = 21. \] 
Solve for \(s\).
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
**Step 3:** Calculate the side length \(s\) in terms of the total sum of the altitudes.

Solve the equation from Step 2:
\[ s \sqrt{3} = 42 \]
\[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}. \]
Simplifying:
\[s = 14 \sqrt{3}.\]
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
**Step 4:** Calculate the area of \(\triangle ABC\) using its side length.

The formula for the area \(A\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is:
\[ A = \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}. \]
Substitute \(s = 14 \sqrt{3}\) into the area formula:
\[ A = \frac{(14 \sqrt{3})^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}. \]
Simplify:
\[ A = \frac{196 \cdot 3 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{4} = 147 \sqrt{3}. \]
