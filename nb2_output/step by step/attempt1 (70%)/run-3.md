Verify the current step: 
1. **Understand Key Concepts and Theorems**: 
   - When point $P$ is inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides of the triangle remains constant, equivalent to the altitude of the triangle.
   - For an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the altitude or height can be calculated using the formula: $\text{Height} = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
2. **Sum of the Perpendicular Distances**:
   - Given that the altitudes from $P$ to sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ are 8, 6, and 7 respectively.
   - The sum of these perpendicular distances is $8 + 6 + 7 = 21$.

Verify the current step: 
3. **Calculate the Altitude of Triangle $ABC$**:
   - Since the sum of the perpendicular distances is equal to the height of the equilateral triangle, the height (altitude) of triangle $ABC$ is 21.
Step was correct. Add to verified
Verify the current step: 
4. **Determine the Side Length**: 
  - Use the formula for the altitude: $\text{Height} = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}$ to find the side length $s$.
  - Set $\frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} = 21$ and solve for $s$:
     
     \[ \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} = 21 \]
     \[ s \sqrt{3} = 42 \]
     \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]
     \[ s = 14\sqrt{3} \]

Verify the current step: 
5. **Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**:
   - Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: $\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2$
   - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the area formula:
     
     \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
     \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
     \[ \text{Area} = 147\sqrt{3} \]
   - Calculate or simplify further if necessary.
