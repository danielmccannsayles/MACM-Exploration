Round 1: 

Oohh

So 3/40 were wrong total. This is a 92.5% success rate which is pretty good..

This is honestly kind of weird since I'm only checking if the last step is correct. I'm also still doing the sanity check..

Round 2: Now we wait for the MIN tries, and we check the answer given all the steps. This does pretty well, though it feels less elegant imo.
