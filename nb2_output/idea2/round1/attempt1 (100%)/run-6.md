    - \( s = \frac{42 \times \sqrt{3}}{3} \)
    - \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \) checks out accurately.

2. **Cross-Verification through Area Formula:**

   - Using given triangle properties, derived
     \[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} \times (8 + 6 + 7) \]
   - Simplify to check if the consistent result arises:
     \[  = \frac{1}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} \times 21 = 21 \times 14 \cdot \frac{3}{4} \]
   - Calculate numerically:\
    \( = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 \times 21 \times \sqrt{3} = 147\sqrt{3} \)
