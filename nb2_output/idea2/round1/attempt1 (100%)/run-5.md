Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the geometry of the problem**
- Consider an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with a point $P$ inside.
- Drop perpendiculars from $P$ to all three sides:
  - From $P$ to $\overline{AB}$, the perpendicular is 8.
  - From $P$ to $\overline{BC}$, the perpendicular is 6.
  - From $P$ to $\overline{CA}$, the perpendicular is 7.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Recognize the property related to the point P**
- By Viviani's theorem, for any interior point $P$ inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
- Let the altitude of $\triangle ABC$ be $h$.
- Viviani's theorem gives us: 
  $$8 + 6 + 7 = h.$$
Step 3:
**Step 3: Solve the result from Viviani's theorem**
- Calculate $h$: 
  $$h = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21.$$ 
- This means the altitude of triangle $ABC$ is 21.
Step 4:
**Step 4: Find the relationship between side length and the altitude for an equilateral triangle**
- For an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the altitude $h$ is given by:
  $$ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s $$
- Equating this with our $h$:
  $$ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 21. $$
- Solve for $s$:
  $$ s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}. $$
Step 5:
**Step 5: Calculate the area of triangle $ABC$**
- The area of an equilateral triangle is:
  $$ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 $$
- Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:
  $$ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 $$
- Calculate:
  $$ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3 = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} = 147 \sqrt{3}. $$
