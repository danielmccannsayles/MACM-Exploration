Step 1:
**Step 1:** Understand the Setup and Recall Viviani's Theorem
   - An equilateral triangle, such as $\triangle ABC$, has all sides and angles equal. When point $P$ is inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances (altitudes) from the point to the sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
   - Viviani's Theorem states: "For any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the three sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle."
   - Given distances:  8, 6, and 7.
   - The sum of these distances: $8 + 6 + 7 = 21$.
Step 2:
**Step 2:** Compute the Altitude of $\triangle ABC$
   - According to Viviani's Theorem, the sum of these altitudes ($21$) is equal to the altitude of the equilateral triangle $\triangle ABC$.
   - Thus, the altitude of $\triangle ABC$ is $21$.
Step 3:
**Step 3:** Use the Altitude to Find the Side Length of $\triangle ABC$
   - The formula for the altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle in terms of its side length $s$ is given by:  
     $$ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s $$
   - Rearrange the formula to solve for $s$ (the side length):
     $$ s = \frac{2h}{\sqrt{3}} $$
   - Substitute the value of $h = 21$:
     $$ s = \frac{2(21)}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} $$
Step 4:
**Step 4:** Calculate the Area of $\triangle ABC$
   - The formula for the area $A$ of an equilateral triangle given its side length $s$ is:
     $$ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 $$
   - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the area formula:
     $$ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 $$
     $$ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(196 \times 3) $$
     $$ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 $$
     $$ A = \sqrt{3} \times 147 $$
Step 5:
**Step 5:** Finalize and Express the Area in Simplest Terms
   - Compute the final expression for the area:
     $$ A = 147\sqrt{3} $$
     - Therefore, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is **147√3 square units**.
