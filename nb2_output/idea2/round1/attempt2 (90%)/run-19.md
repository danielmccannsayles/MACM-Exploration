Step 1:
To solve this problem, we'll use a well-known result for the area of an equilateral triangle when a point inside it has known perpendicular distances to its sides. Specifically, if a point inside an equilateral triangle has perpendicular distances (usually called the renditions) to the three sides of lengths $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$, the area of the triangle can be calculated as $\frac{1}{2} \times (d_1 + d_2 + d_3) \times s$, where $s$ is the side length of the equilateral triangle.
Step 2:
The sum of the distances from any internal point in an equilateral triangle to the three sides is equal to the length of the altitude of that equilateral triangle. Thus, set $h = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21$. Here, $h$ is the height (altitude) of triangle $ABC$. The relationship between the side length $s$ of an equilateral triangle and its altitude $h$ is given by $s = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}h$.
Step 3:
Since we now know $h = 21$, we can find $s$ using the formula for the side of an equilateral triangle in terms of its height: 
- $s = \frac{2\times21}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}$.
- Rationalize the denominator to get: $s = \frac{42 \times \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}$.
Step 4:
Now, we find the area $K$ of triangle $ABC$ using the side length $s = 14\sqrt{3}$. The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle in terms of its side $s$ is $K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2$. Use this to find $K$:
- $K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(196 \times 3) = 147 \sqrt{3}$.
Step 5:
The area of triangle $ABC$ is thus $147 \sqrt{3}$. Alternatively, notice that because the point $P$ divides the triangle's height into three parts (the lengths 8, 6, 7), the sum of these parts directly using the property $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{(sum of altitudes)} \times s = 147 \sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the final computed area of triangle $ABC$ is $147 \sqrt{3}$ square units.>>
