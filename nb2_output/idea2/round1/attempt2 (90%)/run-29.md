**Step 3: Use the Formula for Area of Equilateral Triangle**
The area of an equilateral triangle $ABC$ based on its side length $x$ is:

Additionally, the area can also be expressed in terms of its total height $h_{total}$ from its top vertex to its base, which is given by:

$$ h_{total} = \frac{x \sqrt{3}}{2} $$

Thus, the area in terms of the triangle's congruent sides and individual perpendicular heights is formulated as:
$$ A_{ABC} = \frac{x}{2} \times (8 + 6 + 7) = \frac{x}{2} \times 21 $$>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step involves finding the area of the equilateral triangle \( \triangle ABC \) using its side lengths and the perpendicular heights given. Let's verify each part of this step:

1. **Formula for Equilateral Triangle Area in Terms of Side Length:** 
   - The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle in terms of its side length \( x \) is correct:
   \[ A_{ABC} = \frac{x^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} \]

2. **Formula for Total Height \( h_{total} \):**
   - The formula to calculate the total height from the top vertex to the base of an equilateral triangle using its side length \( x \) is:
   \[ h_{total} = \frac{x \sqrt{3}}{2} \]
   This calculation is correct.

3. **Area in Terms of Base and Sum of Heights:**
   - The current step seems to indicate a calculation of the area by using a base \( x \) multiplied by the sum of the given perpendicular heights (\( 8, 6, \) and \( 7 \)):
   \[ A_{ABC} = \frac{x}{2} \times (8 + 6 + 7) = \frac{x}{2} \times 21 \]
   
   Here, the formula is misstated. The correct formulation should individually use each base side length and the corresponding height/new base.
   
   Considering that equilateral triangles can be partitioned into smaller triangles with an internal point, the sum of such heights correctly added should equate to an aggregate comparison but multiplied appropriately.
   
   - Setting up the area equation this way directly from these heights/bases without recalculation implies they form a direct proportional relation.
   
   **Correction Needed:**
   - The area expression \( \frac{x}{2} \times 21 \) mistakenly suggests a direct summation in this setup without deducing the correct side measure or consideration of symmetry relationships regarding such internal points.>> 
Fixed step: **Step 3: Use the Correct Formula for Area and Heights**

To find the area of equilateral triangle \( \triangle ABC \) using the perpendicular distances from point \( P \), we need to correctly add the areas of the smaller triangles formed by these heights. The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle based on these internal heights is derived as follows:

Given that the height from each side, \( AB, BC, \) and \( CA \), is \( h_1 = 8, h_2 = 6, \) and \( h_3 = 7 \) respectively, we use Viviani's theorem, which states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of an equilateral triangle is equal to the height of the triangle. Thus, if \( x \) is the side length of \( \triangle ABC \), its total height is:

\[ 
h_{total} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times x 
\]

According to Viviani's theorem:
\[ 
h_1 + h_2 + h_3 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times x 
\]

This gives:
\[ 
8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times x 
\]

Which simplifies to:
\[ 
21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times x 
\]

Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ 
x = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} 
\]

The area \( A_{ABC} \) of the equilateral triangle is then:
\[ 
A_{ABC} = \frac{x^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{(14\sqrt{3})^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} 
\]

Finally, compute this area:
\[ 
A_{ABC} = \frac{196 \cdot 3 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3} 
\]

This approach corrects how we use the internal heights to compute the triangle's side and area correctly.>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 3: Leverage the Properties of Equilateral Triangles**

For an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, each side is equal, and any altitude will drop perpendicularly from a vertex to the midpoint of its opposite side. We can denote these altitudes as $h$. In equilateral triangle $ABC$, these sides will form smaller, similar triangles with vertex $P$. Instead of focusing directly
t on side lengths, focus on height.

* The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle using one of its altitudes is:
$$A_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \times (s) \times h_{total},$$
where $h_{total}$ is the known length of the altitude of the entire triangle.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step attempts to leverage the properties of an equilateral triangle to find its area using the altitude and side length. However, it misidentifies what constitutes the correct approach to compute the area of $\triangle ABC$ given the information.

**Issues with the Current Step:**
1. **Misapplication of Altitudes:** The method mentions using "altitude of the entire triangle" to find its area, but that's irrelevant because we need the sum of areas of smaller triangles formed by point $P$, due to given altitudes from $P$.
2. **Altitude Formula Confusion:** It introduces a formula considering an overall triangle altitude which wasn't available or considered in previous parts of the problem. We have specific heights from the interior point $P$ to triangle sides.
3. **Misunderstanding of Configuration**: The formula aims to calculate the area directly using the overall altitude, rather than using the final altitude sum required to combine smaller triangles' areas.

**Correct Explanation Should Include:**
- The total height $h_{total}$ is not directly provided. Instead, the problem gives internal perpendicular distances (altitudes) from $P$, which should be summed to find the total area.>> 
Fixed step: **Step 3: Calculate the Area of Equilateral Triangle Using Point $P$**

We are given the altitudes from point $P$ to each side of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ as 8, 6, and 7. The area of $\triangle ABC$ can be found by summing the areas of the smaller triangles $\triangle PAB$, $\triangle PBC$, and $\triangle PCA$ using these altitudes:

The total area of $\triangle ABC$ is:

\[ A_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \times s_{AB} \times 8 + \frac{1}{2} \times s_{BC} \times 6 + \frac{1}{2} \times s_{CA} \times 7. \]

Since $ABC$ is equilateral, $s_{AB} = s_{BC} = s_{CA}$, so:

\[ A_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (8 + 6 + 7). \]

Thus, the area of $\triangle ABC$ can be calculated as:

\[ A_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times 21 = \frac{21s}{2}. \]

To solve for the actual area value, remember that each side length $s$ must be expressed in terms of the altitudes or use the known sum of altitudes directly to solve for $A_{ABC}$. But since these add up to the 21 and match the form of the area for equilateral, the problem simplifies.

To utilize the figure's symmetry:

\[ h = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21. \]
Where $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s$, thus equate:

\[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s. \]

Solving for $s$ yields:

\[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}. \]

Rationalize to simplify, typically rendering $s$ value basic to solution development when $\sqrt{3}$ is fully interpretable.

**Step 5: Use the Side Length to Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC**

Step 1:
**Step 1: Understanding the Geometry of the Problem**
To solve this problem, we need to leverage the properties of the equilateral triangle and the given geometry:
- An equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles equal to 60 degrees.
- Point $P$ is inside triangle $ABC$, and the problem describes distances from $P$ to each side of the triangle (which are perpendiculars).
- These perpendicular distances from $P$ to the triangle sides are effectively the heights of smaller triangles within $ABC$. Let's denote these smaller triangles' areas as $[PAB]$, $[PBC]$, and $[PCA]$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Apply the Formula for Area in Terms of Perpendicular Heights**
To find the area of $
abla ABC$, we should utilize the fact that the sum of the areas of these smaller triangles equals the area of $
abla ABC$:

$$ A_{ABC} = A_{PAB} + A_{PBC} + A_{PCA}. $$

For any triangle, its area can also be expressed in terms of base and height:
$$ A_{PAB} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot s_{AB} \cdot h_1, $$
$$ A_{PBC} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot s_{BC} \cdot h_2, $$
$$ A_{PCA} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot s_{CA} \cdot h_3, $$

where $h_1 = 8$, $h_2 = 6$, and $h_3 = 7$.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Calculate the Area of Equilateral Triangle Using Point $P$**

We are given the altitudes from point $P$ to each side of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ as 8, 6, and 7. The area of $\triangle ABC$ can be found by summing the areas of the smaller triangles $\triangle PAB$, $\triangle PBC$, and $\triangle PCA$ using these altitudes:

The total area of $\triangle ABC$ is:

\[ A_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \times s_{AB} \times 8 + \frac{1}{2} \times s_{BC} \times 6 + \frac{1}{2} \times s_{CA} \times 7. \]

Since $ABC$ is equilateral, $s_{AB} = s_{BC} = s_{CA}$, so:

\[ A_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (8 + 6 + 7). \]

Thus, the area of $\triangle ABC$ can be calculated as:

\[ A_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times 21 = \frac{21s}{2}. \]

To solve for the actual area value, remember that each side length $s$ must be expressed in terms of the altitudes or use the known sum of altitudes directly to solve for $A_{ABC}$. But since these add up to the 21 and match the form of the area for equilateral, the problem simplifies. Recognizing brommetric consistency with these steps completes the logical calculation for a refined step toward completion.
Step 4:
**Step 4: Relate the Altitudes to the Side Length of the Triangle**

Since $ABC$ is an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and therefore each smaller triangle formed by $P$ can be complemented into the area of $ABC$ through consistent partitioning.

To utilize the figure's symmetry:
- Express each altitude in terms of $s$, the side of the equilateral triangle. This leverages that in equilateral triangles, any altitude is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times$ side.

However, this involves recalling the relationship uniquely processed in consistently partitioned areas such that:

Given typical properties, **the sum of the perpendicular distances to each side from any interior point $P$ equals the altitude of the equilateral triangle.**
    
\[ h = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21. \]
Where $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s$, thus equate:

\[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s. \]

Solving for $s$ yields:

\[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}. \]

Rationalize to simplify, typically rendering $s$ value basic to solution development when $\sqrt{3}$ is fully interpretable.

**Step 5: Use the Side Length to Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC**

Substitute any value of $s$ into the equilateral triangle area formula:

\[ A_{ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \left(\frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2. \]
Step 5:
- Simplify the expression:

\[ A_{ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times \left(\frac{1764}{3} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588. \]

Continuing simplification considering perfect subreddit fraction properties:

\[ A_{ABC} = 147 \sqrt{3}. \]
