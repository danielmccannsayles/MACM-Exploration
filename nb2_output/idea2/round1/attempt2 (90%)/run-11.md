Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 2**: Recall the formula for the area of a triangle using a point inside.
- The area of triangle $ABC$ can be found using the formula involving a point inside:
  
  $$Area = \frac{1}{2} (d_1 + d_2 + d_3) \times a$$
  
  where $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$ are perpendicular distances from point $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$; and $a$ is the side of the equilateral triangle.
- Here, $d_1 = 8$, $d_2 = 6$, and $d_3 = 7$.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step involves using the formula for the area of a triangle with any point inside, often applied to the geometric property of an equilateral triangle:

1. **Overview of the Formula**:
   - The formula: \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (d_1 + d_2 + d_3) \times a \) is mentioned for calculating the area of triangle with an internal point sectioning the triangle into smaller regions.
   - The terms \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\) represent the perpendicular distances from the internal point, \(P\), to the sides.
   - The variable \(a\) refers to the side length of the equilateral triangle.

2. **Appropriateness of the Formula**:
   - The formula mentioned is incorrect for the given purpose. 
   - The correct formula actually derives from Viviani's theorem, which in this context implies the area of \(\triangle ABC\) should be calculated as:
     \[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{a}{2} \times (d_1 + d_2 + d_3) \]
   - This would be possible if the altitude length for the full triangle is known, using the relationship that \(d_1 + d_2 + d_3\) gives some insight into the height behavior within the triangle.
   - The current scenario lacks the context needed to directly apply a formula unless the side length, \(a\), is known or derived separately.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (d_1 + d_2 + d_3) \times a \) is inconsistent with standard geometric methods for calculating the area from interior distances.
   - More context or derivation is necessary to conclude the area without assuming \( a \) is given.

Therefore, the current step incorrectly utilizes the formula and cannot be used to find the area without further insight or derivation.>> 
Fixed step: **Step 2**: Use Viviani's Theorem to find the area in terms of side length \( a \).

- Viviani's Theorem states that for any interior point \( P \) of an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from \( P \) to the sides is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle.
- Let the side length of the equilateral triangle be \( a \). The altitude of the triangle is given by \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a \).
- According to Viviani's Theorem: \( 8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a \).
- From this, solve for \( a \): \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a = 21 \), so \( a = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \).
- Now, calculate the area of triangle \( ABC \) using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: 
  \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = 147 \text{ square units}. \]>>

Step 1:
**Step 1**: Understand and visualize the given problem.
- You have an equilateral triangle $ABC$, and a point $P$ inside the triangle.
- From $P$, perpendiculars are drawn to each side of the triangle, which are essentially the altitudes from $P$ to the sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$.
- These perpendicular distances are 8, 6, and 7 respectively.
- The task is to find the area of triangle $ABC$.
Step 2:
**Step 2**: Use Viviani's Theorem to find the area in terms of side length \( a \).

- Viviani's Theorem states that for any interior point \( P \) of an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from \( P \) to the sides is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle.
- Let the side length of the equilateral triangle be \( a \). The altitude of the triangle is given by \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a \).
- According to Viviani's Theorem: \( 8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a \).
- From this, solve for \( a \): \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a = 21 \), so \( a = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \).
- Now, calculate the area of triangle \( ABC \) using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: 
  \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = 147 \text{ square units}. \]
Step 3:
**Step 3**: Confirm the calculation of the side length and altitude. 
   - From Viviani's Theorem, the combined height from point $P$ is equal to the altitude.
   - You've already calculated that: \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a = 21 \]
   - Solving for side length $a$:
     \[ a = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \] 
   - The calculation of $a$ appears correct based on these steps.
Step 4:
**Step 4**: Calculate the complete altitude of triangle $ABC$ for a side length of $14\sqrt{3}$. 
   - Calculate the altitude using the formula for an equilateral triangle:
     \[ \text{Altitude} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a \]
   - Substitute $a = 14\sqrt{3}$:
     \[ \text{Altitude} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} = \frac{42}{2} = 21 \]
   - This confirms that Viviani's Theorem provides aligned results with the altitude derived from the side length.
Step 5:
**Step 5**: Calculate the area of triangle $ABC$ using the derived side and standard formula.
   - With $a = 14\sqrt{3}$ and knowing the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:
     \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 \]
   - Substitute for $a$: 
     \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \ = 147 \text{ square units}\]

     - Area of $\triangle PCA = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times 7$
   - Total area for triangle $ABC$ combining all smaller triangles:
     \[ \text{Total Area} = \frac{1}{2}s(8 + 6 + 7) = \frac{1}{2}s(21) \]
   - Given that s is $14\sqrt{3}$: 
     \[ \text{Total Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} \times 21 = 147 \text{ square units}\]
