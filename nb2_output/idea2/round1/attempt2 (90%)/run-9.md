Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the Problem through Geometry Insight**  
First, let's understand the geometry involved. Given point $P$ inside an equilateral triangle $ABC$, we have altitudes from $P$ to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ with known lengths. Let the feet of the altitudes be $D$, $E$, and $F$ respectively. The altitudes are lines perpendicular to the sides from $P$: 
- $PD = 8$
- $PE = 6$
- $PF = 7$

Note: In any triangle, the area can be calculated using the sum of the perpendicular distances from any internal point to the sides.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Apply Viviani's Theorem**  
Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the three sides equals the height of the triangle. Denote the side length of $\triangle ABC$ as $s$. The height $h$ of an equilateral triangle can be expressed as:  
\[h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s\]
Using Viviani's Theorem:
\[8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s\]
\[21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s\]
Step 3:
**Step 3: Solve for Side Length $s$**
Given the equation, solve for $s$: 
\[s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}}\]
\[s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}\]
Rationalizing the denominator, 
\[s = \frac{42 \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14 \sqrt{3}\] 
Thus, the side length of the triangle is $14\sqrt{3}$.
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**  
The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is given by:
\[\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\]
Substitute the calculated side length:
\[= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14 \sqrt{3})^2\]
\[= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3\]
\[= \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4}\]
\[= 147 \sqrt{3}\]
Thus, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $147 \sqrt{3}$.
Step 5:
**Step 5: Verify Dimensions and Consider Edge Cases**
Verifying:
Using the calculated side length $s = 14 \sqrt{3}$, the dimensions satisfy Viviani's theorem; the sum of perpendiculars equals calculated height $21$. Furthermore:
- Altitudes from point $P$ align with dimension restrictions given $s$ is realistic for positive lengths of $PD, PE, PF$
- The consistency in dimensions confirms the accuracy in area calculation. 
Therefore, triangle $ABC$'s area is \(147 \sqrt{3}\).>>
