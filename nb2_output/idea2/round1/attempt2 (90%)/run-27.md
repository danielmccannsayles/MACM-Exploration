Step 1:
**Step 1: Use Viviani's Theorem**  
Viviani's Theorem states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from a point inside an equilateral triangle to its sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle. Calculate the sum of the distances from point $P$ to the sides:

\[
\text{Sum of altitudes} = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21
\]
Step 2:
**Step 2: Express the altitude of triangle $ABC$**
Since the sum of perpendiculities from point $P$ is equal to the altitude of the triangle, we establish that:

\[
\text{Altitude of } \triangle ABC = 21
\]
The altitude of the triangle with side length $s$ in an equilateral triangle is given by:

\[
\text{Altitude} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s
\]
Step 3:
**Step 3: Solve for side length $s$**  
Equate the expressions for the altitude:

\[
21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s
\]
Solve for $s$:

\[
s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}
\]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the area of triangle $ABC$**  
The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]
Substitute the side length $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2
\]
Simplify:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3 = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3}
\]
Step 5:
**Step 5: Conclude the solution**
