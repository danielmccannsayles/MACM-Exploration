We have our verified steps:==========

Step 1:
First, understand the problem's setup: We have an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with point $P$ inside. The perpendicular distances (altitudes) from $P$ to each side of the triangle ($\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$) are given as 8, 6, and 7 respectively. The task is to find the area of triangle $ABC$.
Step 2:
Recognize and apply Viviani's Theorem, which states: In an equilateral triangle of side length $s$, with any point $P$ inside, the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides is equal to the height $h$ of the triangle. This height can be found using the formula $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s$ for side $s$ of the triangle.
Step 3:
Apply Viviani's Theorem:  The sum of the altitudes from point $P$ to each side, 8 + 6 + 7 = 21, is equal to the height $h$ of the triangle. Use this information to find the side length $s$: 

1. Set $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21$
2. Solving for $s$ gives: $s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = 14 \sqrt{3}$
Step 4:
Calculate the area of triangle $ABC$: Knowing the side length $s$, use the area formula for an equilateral triangle: 

- \( \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \)
- Plugging the side length, $14 \sqrt{3}$, into the formula:
  \[
    \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14 \sqrt{3})^2
  \]
- Simplify the expression:
  \(
    (14 \sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588
  \)
- Thus, the area becomes:
  \(
    \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588
  \)
Step 5:
Finally, complete the area calculation:

1. Simplify \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \):
2. \( 588 \div 4 = 147\)
3. Thus, the area is: \(
   \text{Area} = 147 \sqrt{3} 
   \) square units. 

Hence, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $147 \sqrt{3}$ square units.

  - **Side Length Calculation**:

    2. With the height $h$, and knowing $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$, solve for $s$:

    \[ s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} \]

   \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]

   \[ s = 14\sqrt{3} \]

  - **Area Calculation**:

    3. With $s = 14\sqrt{3}$, calculate the area:

   \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]

    \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]

    \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]

4. Simplify:
  
   - Divide by 4:

  \[ 588 \div 4 = 147 \]

   So:
