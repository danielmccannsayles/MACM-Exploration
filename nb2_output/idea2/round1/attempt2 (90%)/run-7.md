**Step 3: Relate Height to Side Length in an Equilateral Triangle**  
For an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the height $h$ is given by the formula:

$$h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$$  

Solving for $s$ using the information that $h = 21$:

$$21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s \\
\Rightarrow s = \frac{2 \times 21}{\sqrt{3}} \\
\Rightarrow s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \\

Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the Problem**  
The problem gives an equilateral triangle $ABC$ and a point $P$ inside it such that the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ are 8, 6, and 7 units respectively. Our goal is to find the area of the triangle $ABC$. We'll use known results about equilateral triangles and points inside them to solve the problem. 
Step 2:
**Step 2: Introduce Viviani's Theorem**  
Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the three sides is equal to the height of the triangle. Thus, given the information:
  
$$d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = h $$

where $d_1, d_2, d_3$ are the altitudes (8, 6, 7 respectively). Inputting these values:
  
$$8 + 6 + 7 = h \rightarrow h = 21$$

Thus, the height of triangle $ABC$ is 21 units. 
Step 3:
**Step 3: Relate Height to Side Length in an Equilateral Triangle**  
For an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the height $h$ is given by the formula:

$$h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$$  

Solving for $s$ using the information that $h = 21$:

$$21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s \\
\Rightarrow s = \frac{2 \times 21}{\sqrt{3}} \\
\Rightarrow s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \\
\Rightarrow s = 14\sqrt{3}$$

Thus, the side length $s$ of triangle $ABC$ is $14\sqrt{3}$.
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate Area of Triangle $ABC$**  
The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ can be found using the formula:

$$A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$$  

Substituting $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:

$$A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 \\
= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times [14^2 \times 3] \\
= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \\
= 147 \sqrt{3}$$

Thus, the area of the triangle is $147 \sqrt{3}$ square units.
