The area (\(A\)) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is calculated as:

In an equilateral triangle, Viviani's Theorem states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any point inside the triangle to the sides equals the length of the altitude of the triangle. Given distances are from point $P$ to each side: 8, 6, and 7.

So, \[
8 + 6 + 7 = Altitude of \triangle ABC. 
\]
Step 2:
**Step 2: Calculate the Altitude of $\triangle ABC$**

Add the distances calculated in Step 1:
\[8 + 6 + 7 = 21.\]
Thus, the altitude of \(\triangle ABC\) is 21 units.

This crucial insight allows us to deduce the side length of the equilateral triangle next.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Express the Altitude in Terms of Side Length**

For an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\), the altitude (\(h\)) is given by the formula:
\[h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s.\]
We know from Step 2 that \(h = 21\). Thus:
\[\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s = 21.\]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Solve for the Side Length of the Triangle**

Rearrange the equation from Step 3 to solve for \(s\):
\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s &= 21 \\
s &= \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} \\
s &= \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \\
s &= 14\sqrt{3}.
\end{align*}
\]
Step 5:
**Step 5: Calculate the Area of $\triangle ABC$**

The area (\(A\)) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is calculated as:
\[
A = \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}.
\]
Substitute \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\) from Step 4:
\[
\begin{align*}
A &= \frac{(14\sqrt{3})^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} \\
&= \frac{196 \times 3 \times \sqrt{3}}{4} \\
&= \frac{588 \times \sqrt{3}}{4} \\
&= 147 \times \sqrt{3}. 
\end{align*}
\]
Thus, the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is \(147\sqrt{3}\).
