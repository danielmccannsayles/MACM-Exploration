Step 1:
**Step 1: Utilize Symmetry in Equilateral Triangle.**

For an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side length $s$, the altitude from any vertex is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$. Note that if $P$ is a point inside the triangle, then the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides equals the altitude of the triangle, due to the property of equilaterality.
Step 2:


**Step 2: Set Up the Equation.**

Given the point $P$ inside triangle $ABC$ with known altitudes to each $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ being 8, 6, and 7 respectively. Using the property mentioned:
  
\[ h_{\triangle ABC} = d_{\overline{AB}} + d_{\overline{BC}} + d_{\overline{CA}} = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21. \]  

This gives us the height $h_{\triangle ABC}$ of the entire equilateral triangle.
Step 3:


**Step 3: Calculate the Side Length $s$.**

The height $h_{\triangle ABC}$ is related to the side length $s$ by:

\[ h_{\triangle ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s. \]

Plugging $h_{\triangle ABC} = 21$ into the equation, solve for $s$:

\[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]  
\[ s = \frac{21 \/ \times \/ 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]  
\[ s = 14 \sqrt{3}. \]
Step 4:


**Step 4: Derive the Area of Equilateral Triangle $ABC$.**

The formula for the area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side $s$ is:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2. \]

Substitute $s = 14 \sqrt{3}$ into the formula:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14 \sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \/ \times \/ 588. \]  

\[ A = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4} \]  

\[ A = 147 \sqrt{3} .\]
Step 5:


**Step 5: Simplify and End with Solution.**

Finally, simplify the expression for clarity:

\[ A = 147 \sqrt{3} .\]

Thus, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\boxed{147 \sqrt{3}}$.>>
