Verifying current step: 
**Step 1: Apply Viviani's Theorem**  
Viviani's Theorem states that for any point P inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from P to the sides of the triangle is equal to the height of the triangle.

- Assign the following:
  - Distance from P to AB = 8
  - Distance from P to BC = 6
  - Distance from P to AC = 7
- Set the sum:
  \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Determine the Height of Triangle ABC**  
In an equilateral triangle, the height (h) is related to the side length (s) through the formula:
\[
h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s
\]
Since 21 (sum of distances from P) equals the height, solve for s:
\[
h = 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s
\] 
- Rearrange to solve for s:
\[
s = \frac{2 \times 21}{\sqrt{3}}
\]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 3: Calculate the Side Length of Triangle ABC**  
Isolate s from the equation:
\[
s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}
\]
- Thus, the side length s of triangle ABC is \[ 14\sqrt{3} \].>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 4: Calculate the Area of Triangle ABC**  
The area A of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by:
\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]
Plug in s = \[ 14\sqrt{3} \]:
\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588
\]
- Calculate further: 
\[
A = \frac{589\sqrt{3}}{4} = 147 \sqrt{3}
\]

\[
h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s
\]
Since 21 (sum of distances from P) equals the height, solve for s:

The area A of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by:
\[
