**Step 1: Identify the Area of Triangle $ABC$ Using Interior Point Property**  
A known property about an interior point $P$ inside an equilateral triangle $ABC$ is that the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the three sides is equal to the triangle’s altitude. For triangle $ABC$ with side length $s$, the altitude $(h)$ is given by:
\[
    h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s
\]
Given that $h_A = 8$, $h_B = 6$, and $h_C = 7$, the sum is:
\[
    h_A + h_B + h_C = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21
\]
This sum should equal the altitude of the equilateral triangle.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Find the Side Length of Triangle $ABC$**
Using the fact that the altitude $h$ of triangle $ABC$ is 21, solve for the side length $s$:
\[
    \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s = 21
\]
Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate $s$:
\[
    \sqrt{3} \times s = 42
\]
Divide both sides by $\sqrt{3}$:
\[
    s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
Rationalize the denominator:
\[
    s = \frac{42 \times \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}
\]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 3: Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**
The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle is given by:
\[
    A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]
Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:
\[
    A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2
\]
Calculate $s^2$:
\[
    s^2 = (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588
\]
Now calculate the area:
\[
    A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
Simplify:
\[
    A = 147\sqrt{3}

**Step 4: Verify Correctness Using Area Conditions**
Check if the condition that the area computed through $h_A$, $h_B$, and $h_C$ matches the area calculated.

- $\triangle PBC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times 6$

Sum of the areas should equal $\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3}$:
\[
    \frac{s \times 8}{2} + \frac{s \times 6}{2} + \frac{s \times 7}{2} = \frac{21s}{2}

Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:

We have our verified steps:==========

Step 1:
**Step 1: Identify the Area of Triangle $ABC$ Using Interior Point Property**  
A known property about an interior point $P$ inside an equilateral triangle $ABC$ is that the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the three sides is equal to the triangle’s altitude. For triangle $ABC$ with side length $s$, the altitude $(h)$ is given by:
\[
    h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s
\]
Given that $h_A = 8$, $h_B = 6$, and $h_C = 7$, the sum is:
\[
    h_A + h_B + h_C = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21
\]
This sum should equal the altitude of the equilateral triangle.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Find the Side Length of Triangle $ABC$**
Using the fact that the altitude $h$ of triangle $ABC$ is 21, solve for the side length $s$:
\[
    \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s = 21
\]
Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate $s$:
\[
    \sqrt{3} \times s = 42
\]
Divide both sides by $\sqrt{3}$:
\[
    s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
Rationalize the denominator:
\[
    s = \frac{42 \times \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}
\]
Step 3:
**Step 3: Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**
The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle is given by:
\[
    A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]
Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:
\[
    A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2
\]
Calculate $s^2$:
\[
    s^2 = (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588
\]
Now calculate the area:
\[
    A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
Simplify:
\[
    A = 147\sqrt{3}
\]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Verify Correctness Using Area Conditions**
Check if the condition that the area computed through $h_A$, $h_B$, and $h_C$ matches the area calculated.
Each small triangle area from $P$:  
- $\triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times 8$
- $\triangle PBC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times 6$
- $\triangle PCA = \frac{1}{2} \times CA \times 7$

Sum of the areas should equal $\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3}$:
\[
    \frac{s \times 8}{2} + \frac{s \times 6}{2} + \frac{s \times 7}{2} = \frac{21s}{2}
\]
Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:
\[
    \frac{21 \times 14\sqrt{3}}{2}\]
Equals $147\sqrt{3}$, confirming calculation.
Step 5:
**Step 5: Finalization of the Area Calculation of Triangle $ABC$**
Given the previous checks and balance calculations, the correct area for triangle $ABC$ is:

\[
    \boxed{147\sqrt{3}}
