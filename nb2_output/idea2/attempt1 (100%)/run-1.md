**Step 2: Apply the Formula for Area Contribution**
Recall that for a point $P$ inside a triangle $ABC$, the sum of the areas of the smaller triangles formed by point $P$ is equivalent to the area of triangle $ABC$. The area contribution from $P$ with altitude values is given by:
\[ A_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot h_a + \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot h_b + \frac{1}{2} \cdot c \cdot h_c \]
where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the side lengths and $h_a$, $h_b$, and $h_c$ are the perpendicular distances from point $P$.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step involves applying a formula to calculate the area of equilateral triangle $ABC$ using the altitudes from point $P$. Let's evaluate this formula:

### Analysis:

1. **Area of Sub-Triangles:**
   - The equation provided seems to suggest partitioning the entire triangle $ABC$ into smaller sub-triangles formed by connecting point $P$ to each vertex thereby calculating the total area through these sub-areas.

2. **Area Calculation Dependencies:**
   - The formula provided appears as:
     \[ A_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot h_a + \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot h_b + \frac{1}{2} \cdot c \cdot h_c \]
   - The understanding is incorrect; this formula attempts to express the total area directly from side lengths and perpendicular distances, which is not valid.

3. **Correct Interpretation:**
   - For an equilateral triangle with altitudes from an interior point, the correct area computation should rely on the known fact (Vivianiâ€™s theorem for equilateral triangles):
     \[ h_a + h_b + h_c = h \]
     where $h$ is the altitude of the equilateral triangle.
   - Therefore, calculating individual sub-area contributions using half-area products as given is inconsistent with true area computation for equilateral arrangements.

### Conclusion:
   - There's a misinterpretation in applying this formula directly to equilateral triangles from inner point $P$ leading to an incorrect approach.

This step is not correct based on the understanding and evaluation of geometric arrangements and necessary formula application for equilateral triangles.>> 
Fixed step: **Step 2: Use Viviani's Theorem for Equilateral Triangles**

For an equilateral triangle $ABC$, Viviani's theorem tells us that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point $P$ to the sides of the triangle equals the altitude of the triangle. Given:

- The perpendicular distance from point $P$ to side $\overline{AB}$ is 8.
- The perpendicular distance from point $P$ to side $\overline{BC}$ is 6.
- The perpendicular distance from point $P$ to side $\overline{CA}$ is 7.

The sum of these perpendicular distances is:
\[ 8 + 6 + 7 = 21. \]

Therefore, the altitude of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ is 21. Since the area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{s \cdot h}{2} \), where \( s \) is the side length and \( h \) is the altitude. The area of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed in terms of just its altitude 21, knowing that the altitude \( h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot s \):

1. Solve for the side length \( s \) using the altitude:
\[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot s \]

2. Calculate the area once \( s \) is known, since \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot s \cdot h \). 

Thus, the area of triangle $ABC$ follows directly from solving \( h = 21 \) in terms of \( s \).>>

- **Formula Used:**
  - For an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \), the area \( A \) is given by:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times s^2 \]

- **Substituting \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \):**
  - Calculate \( s^2 \):
    - \( (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 14^2 \times 3 = 196 \times 3 = 588 \).
  - Calculate the area \( A \):
    - Substituting into the formula:
    \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
    \[ A = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} \]
    \[ A = 147\sqrt{3} \]

- **Compare with Given Simplification **:
  - Your final step claims \( A = 147 \), ignoring the presence of \( \sqrt{3} \). This suggests there might have been an error in simplification or representation of the final area.

**Conclusion:** The last simplification \( A = 147 \) is incorrect because the area should remain in terms of \( \sqrt{3} \). Therefore, the calculated area should be left in the form \( 147\sqrt{3} \).

Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the Geoemtric Configuration**
To solve the problem effectively, begin by understanding that point $P$ inside triangle $ABC$ has perpendicular distances to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$. These distances are essentially the heights from point $P$ to those corresponding sides.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Utilize Viviani's Theorem**  
Viviani's theorem states that for any internal point $P$ inside an equilateral triangle $ABC$, the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides of the triangle equals the altitude of the triangle.
- 
  \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \]
  This is the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Find the Altitude of Triangle $ABC$**  
Knowing the sum of the perpendicular distances is equal to the altitude of $ABC$, we set the altitude $h = 21$. 
- Given that the altitude $h$ can also be expressed in terms of the side length $s$ of an equilateral triangle:
  \[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s \]
- Getting the side length $s$, we equate:
  \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s = 21 \]
  \[ s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]
  \[ s = 14\sqrt{3} \]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Compute the Area of Triangle \(ABC\)**  
With the side length \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\), we find the area \(A\) of the equilateral triangle \(ABC\):
- The area of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times s^2 \]
  Substituting the side length:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
  \[ A = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} \]
  \[ A = 147\sqrt{3} \]

The area of triangle \(ABC\) is \(147\sqrt{3}\).

**Step 5: Verify the Calculations for Consistency**

Having determined that the side length of triangle $ABC$ is $14\sqrt{3}$ and the area is $147\sqrt{3}$, it is prudent to verify these results for correctness by examining the calculations:

      \[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s \] 
      \[ s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \] confirms the side length. 

2. **Re-evaluate the Area Calculation:**
    - We calculated the area as follows:
      \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
    - Substitution Step:
      \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \] as: 
        (where \( (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588 \))
    - Further Simplification gives:
      \[ A = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3} \]

3. **Logical Consistency:**
    - Reapplying Vivianiâ€™s theorem confirms:
      - The sum of perpendicular distances: \( 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \)

  - $A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times 6$
  - $A_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times CA \times 7$

**Relating Sum of Smaller Areas with $ABC$'s Total Area:**
- The area of $\triangle ABC$ (denoted as $A$) can thus be decomposed as:
  
  \[ A = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 \]
  \[ A = \frac{1}{2} (AB \times 8 + BC \times 6 + CA \times 7) \]

**Simplifying Using the Side Equivalency in $\triangle ABC$:**
- With $
tr AB = BC = CA = s$ for equilateral triangle $ABC$, this expression becomes:
  
  \[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (8 + 6 + 7) = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times 21 \]
