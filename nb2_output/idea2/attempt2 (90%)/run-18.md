### Step 1: Understand the Configuration and Apply Viviani's Theorem
Viviani's Theorem states that for any point P inside an equilateral triangle ABC, the sum of the perpendicular distances from P to the sides of the triangle equals the length of the triangle’s altitude. Let's denote these distances as \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\) for sides \( \overline{AB} \), \( \overline{BC} \), and \( \overline{CA} \) respectively:

\[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = \text{altitude of } \triangle ABC \]

Here, given \(d_1 = 8\), \(d_2 = 6\), and \(d_3 = 7\), calculate:

\[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \]
This tells us that the altitude of triangle \(ABC\) is 21 units.>>

### Step 2: Determine the Side Length of the Triangle ABC

The relationship between the altitude \(h\) and the side length \(s\) of an equilateral triangle is given by:

\[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]

Substituting in the altitude of 21, solve for \(s\):

\[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]
\[ s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \]

Now we have the side length: \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\).>>

### Step 3: Calculate the Area of Triangle ABC

The area \(A\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]

Substitute \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\) into the area formula:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3 \]
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
\[ A = \sqrt{3} \times 147 \]

Simplify the expression:

\[ A = 147\sqrt{3} \]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
### Step 4: Confirmation of the Calculations
Let's verify the calculation for correctness using the derived formulas for side length and area. The side length using the given altitude matches and the holistic integrity of calculations can be checked further, emphasizing accuracy in length dimensions and area expressions:
