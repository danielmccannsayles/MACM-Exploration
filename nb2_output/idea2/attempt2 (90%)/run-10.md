**Step 2: Recall Viviani's Theorem for equilateral triangles.**

Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides of the triangle is equal to the height of the triangle. Mathematically for triangle $ABC$ with side length $s$:

\[
 
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 8 + 6 + 7

**Step 3: Use Viviani's Theorem to solve for the side length $s$.**

From the equation derived in Step 2:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 21

Multiply both sides by \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\) to solve for $s$:

\[
s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}

**Step 4: Calculate the height of triangle $ABC$.**

Remember, the height $h$ of an equilateral triangle is given by:

\[
h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s
\]

Substituting the value of $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:

\[
h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} = \frac{14 \times 3}{2} = 21

The area \(A\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times 21

Plugging in the side length \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\):

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} \times 21 = 147\sqrt{3}.

Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the problem and define the parameters.**

We are given an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with a point $P$ inside it. Perpendicular lines drawn from $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ have lengths 8, 6, and 7 respectively. We need to find the area of triangle $ABC$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Recall Viviani's Theorem for equilateral triangles.**

Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides of the triangle is equal to the height of the triangle. Mathematically for triangle $ABC$ with side length $s$:

\[
 
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 8 + 6 + 7

\]

Calculate the total sum of the perpendicular lengths (8 + 6 + 7 = 21).
Step 3:
**Step 3: Use Viviani's Theorem to solve for the side length $s$.**

From the equation derived in Step 2:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 21
\]

Multiply both sides by \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\) to solve for $s$:

\[
s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}
\]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the height of triangle $ABC$.**

Remember, the height $h$ of an equilateral triangle is given by:

\[
h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s
\]

Substituting the value of $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:

\[
h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} = \frac{14 \times 3}{2} = 21
\]
Step 5:
**Step 5: Calculate the area of triangle $ABC$.**

The area \(A\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times 21
\]

Plugging in the side length \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\):

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} \times 21 = 147\sqrt{3}.
\]

So, the area of triangle $ABC$ is \(147\sqrt{3}\).
Step 6:
**Step 6: Verify the calculations and conclude the solution.**

- We need to ensure the consistency of calculations from each step.
  - Using Viviani's Theorem, derived the side length:
    
  \[
  s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}
  \]
  - Validated this side length to calculate the triangle height:
  
  \[
  h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} = 21
  \]
  - Used height in the area formula:
  
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} \times 21 = 147\sqrt{3}
  \]

- Hence, the solution is verified, and all the methods are consistent:

  **Conclusion**: The area of triangle $ABC$ is \(147\sqrt{3}\).>>
