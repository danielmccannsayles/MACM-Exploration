**Step 1: Understand Viviani's Theorem**

Viviani’s Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from that point to each of the triangle's sides is equal to the length of the triangle's altitude. 

- Let the side of triangle $ABC$ be $s$.
- The altitude of an equilateral triangle with side $s$ is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s \).
- Altitude from $P$ to $\overline{AB}$: 8
- Altitude from $P$ to $\overline{BC}$: 6
- Altitude from $P$ to $\overline{CA}$: 7>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Apply Viviani's Theorem**

According to Viviani's Theorem:

\[
\text{Altitude of } \triangle ABC = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21
\]

- This gives us the total of these perpendiculars, which is also the altitude of the equilateral triangle.
- Therefore, \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s = 21 \).>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 3: Solve for Side Length**

To find the length of side $s$, solve the equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \, s = 21
\]

- Multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \):
 
\[
 s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42 \times \sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

- Simplify:

\[
 s = 14\sqrt{3}
\]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 4: Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**

Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, which is based on its side length:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times s^2
\]

- Substitute \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2
\]

- Simplify:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3
