Step 1:
**Step 1: Identify Known Values and Understand the Problem**
   - We have an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with a point $P$ inside it.
   - The perpendicular distances (altitudes) from point $P$ to the sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ are given as 8, 6, and 7 units respectively.
   - The task is to find the area of triangle $ABC$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Use the Perpendicular Concept of the Equilateral Triangle**
   - Observations about equilateral triangles: All sides have equal length, and all interior angles measure 60 degrees.
   - Key property: If you drop a perpendicular from any point inside an equilateral triangle to any side, the sum of these perpendiculars is  equal to the altitude of the equilateral triangle.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Calculate the Altitude of Triangle $ABC$**
   - Using the property stated in Step 2:
     - Altitude of $\triangle ABC$ (from any vertex) = Sum of the provided altitudes from $P$ to $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$: 
     - $\text{Altitude } = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21$ units.
   - Let's denote the side length of the equilateral triangle $s$.
   - The formula for the altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle with side $s$ is: 
     - $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$
     - Therefore, $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 21$
Step 4:
**Step 4: Solve for the Side Length of Triangle $ABC$**
   - Using the equation $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 21$:
     - Multiply by 2 to clear the fraction: $\sqrt{3} s = 42$
     - Divide by $\sqrt{3}$ to solve for $s$:
     - $s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}$
     - Rationalizing the denominator: $s = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}$
Step 5:
**Step 5: Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**
   - Formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: $\text{Area } = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$
   - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:
     - $\text{Area } = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2$
     - Simplify the expression:
     - Calculate $s^2: (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588$.
     - Substitution gives $\text{Area } = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = 147\sqrt{3}$
   - Thus, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $147\sqrt{3}$ unit².
