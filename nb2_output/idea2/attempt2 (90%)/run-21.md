Verifying current step: 
**Step 1: Understanding Viviani's Theorem**
- Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides of the triangle equals the altitude of the triangle.
- In this problem, we are given the distances from point $P$ to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$, which sum up as follows:
  \[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21. \]>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Calculate the altitude of Triangle $ABC$**
- According to Viviani's Theorem, this sum (21) is equal to the altitude of the equilateral triangle $ABC$.
- Let the side length of triangle $ABC$ be $s$. The formula for the altitude of an equilateral triangle is given by:
  \[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s. \]
- Therefore, setting the two expressions for the height equal:
  \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21 \]
  \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}. \]>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 3: Simplify and Find the Side Length**
- Simplify the expression for $s$ to obtain a rational number.
  \[ s = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}. \]
- Thus, the side length of triangle $ABC$ is $14\sqrt{3}$.>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 4: Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**
- The formula for the area $A$ of an equilateral triangle in terms of its side length $s$ is:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2. \]
- Substituting $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the formula:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2. \]
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
  \[ A = \frac{147 \sqrt{3}}{1}. \]>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 5: Compute and State the Final Answer**
- The area of triangle $ABC$ simplifies to:
  \[ A = 441. \]
- Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is \(441\) square units.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: In the previous steps, the area of triangle $ABC$ was calculated using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
where \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \), the side length of the triangle.

Previously, the area was derived as follows:
1. Substituted \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \) into the area formula:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
2. Simplified the expression:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]

Now, let's verify the simplification of this expression.

- Calculate \((14\sqrt{3})^2\):
  - \((14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588\)

- Therefore:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3} \times 588}{4} = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4}\]
  - \( \frac{588}{4} = 147 \), so:
  \[ A = 147\sqrt{3} \]

- The final simplification step stated:
  \[ A = 441 \]

- There appears to be a misunderstanding or mistake in calculating the square root component of the original equation. The expression \( 147\sqrt{3} \) does not simplify directly to 441. This is incorrect without proper re-evaluation or adjustments.

The correct final form for the area should remain as \( 147\sqrt{3} \).

Thus, the current step is incorrect.
