**Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration**

- Observe that the problem provides altitudes from an internal point $P$ to the sides of equilateral triangle $ABC$.
- Recognize that each of these altitudes represents a perpendicular distance from $P$ to the side of the triangle, which will be critical for determining the area using the properties of an equilateral triangle.

Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Applying Viviani's Theorem**

- Recall Viviani's Theorem, which states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
- Set up the equation with our provided distances: 
  \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = h \]
- Calculate $h$ (altitude of the equilateral triangle $ABC$):
  \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \]>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 3: Relate the Altitude to the Side Length**

- Use the relationship between the side length $s$ of an equilateral triangle and its altitude $h$:
  \[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot s \]
- Set up the equation with $h = 21$:
  \[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot s \]
- Solve for $s$:
  \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration**

- Observe that the problem provides altitudes from an internal point $P$ to the sides of equilateral triangle $ABC$.
- Recognize that each of these altitudes represents a perpendicular distance from $P$ to the side of the triangle, which will be critical for determining the area using the properties of an equilateral triangle.
- Verify the given lengths are altitudes from $P$: 8 to $\overline{AB}$, 6 to $\overline{BC}$, and 7 to $\overline{CA}$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Applying Viviani's Theorem**

- Recall Viviani's Theorem, which states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
- Set up the equation with our provided distances: 
  \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = h \]
- Calculate $h$ (altitude of the equilateral triangle $ABC$):
  \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \]
Step 3:
**Step 3: Relate the Altitude to the Side Length**

- Use the relationship between the side length $s$ of an equilateral triangle and its altitude $h$:
  \[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot s \]
- Set up the equation with $h = 21$:
  \[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot s \]
- Solve for $s$:
  \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]
  - Simplify:
    \[ s = 14\sqrt{3} \]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the Area of Triangle ABC**

- Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:
  \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
- Plug in the value of $s$:
  \[ s^2 = (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588 \]
  \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
- Simplify to find the area:
  \[ \text{Area} = 147 \sqrt{3} \]
Step 5:
**Step 5: Conclusion and Verification**

- Verify the calculations done for $h$, $s$, and area; ensure no computational errors.
