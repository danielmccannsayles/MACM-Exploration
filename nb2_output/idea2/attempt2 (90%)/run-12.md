### Step 1: Understand Viviani’s Theorem
- Viviani's theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the three sides is equal to the height of the triangle.
- Here, altitudes from point $P$ to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ are given, which are 8, 6, and 7 respectively. According to Viviani's Theorem, 8 + 6 + 7 gives the total height of triangle $ABC$.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: Viviani's Theorem is accurately described in the current step. It states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any point inside an equilateral triangle to its sides equals the height of the triangle. In this problem, the relevant perpendicular distances from point P to the sides AB, BC, and CA are given as 8, 6, and 7 respectively.

However, the step makes a misleading conclusion by stating that this sum of the distances (21) directly gives the total height of the triangle ABC. Viviani's Theorem equates the sum of those distances to the height of the equilateral triangle when expressed in terms of a single altitude (or height) from a vertex perpendicular to the opposite side, not the height directly. This incorrect interpretation might lead to an inaccurate calculation of the area if not re-evaluated with the proper understanding.

While the explanation of Viviani's Theorem is clear, the conclusion drawn deviates from the correct application of the theorem, thus rendering the step as inaccurate for directly finding the height of the triangle.>>
