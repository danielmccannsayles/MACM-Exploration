Step 1:
**Step 1: Visualize the Triangle and Altitudes**  
Visualize the equilateral triangle $ABC$ with an interior point $P$. The altitudes from point $P$ to the sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ have given lengths of 8, 6, and 7, respectively. These line segments are perpendicular to the corresponding sides, and they help subdivide the larger triangle into three smaller triangles: $\triangle PAB$, $\triangle PBC$, and $\triangle PCA$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Sum of Areas of the Sub-Triangles**  
Calculate the areas of the smaller triangles $\triangle PAB$, $\triangle PBC$, and $\triangle PCA$. Each area can be calculated as follows using the formula for the area of a triangle:
- Area of $\triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times 8$
- Area of $\triangle PBC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times 6$
- Area of $\triangle PCA = \frac{1}{2} \times CA \times 7$

Since $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, $AB = BC = CA = s$. Thus, the total area of $\triangle ABC$ is the sum of the areas of these three smaller triangles.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Use the Perpendicular Sum Property**  
For any internal point $P$ in an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides equals the altitude of the triangle. Therefore,

\[8 + 6 + 7 = 21 = \text{Altitude of } \triangle ABC.\]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Relate the Altitude to Side Length of Equilateral Triangle**  
The altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle with side $s$ is given by:

\[h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s.\]

Set the altitude equal to the sum of the distances to sides: 

\[\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21.\]

Solve for $s$ (side length of $\triangle ABC$):

\[s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}.\]
Step 5:
**Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Equilateral Triangle**  
Use the formula for the area $A$ of an equilateral triangle:

\[A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2.\]

Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:

\[A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588.\]

Finally, the area simplifies to:

\[A = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3}.\]

Thus, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $ 147\sqrt{3}$.
