Verifying current step: 
### Step 3: Calculate the Side Length $s$
The formula for the altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle in terms of its side length $s$ is:

\[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]

Using this relation:

\[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]

### Step 4: Apply the Area Formula for an Equilateral Triangle
The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]

Substitute \( s = 14 \sqrt{3} \) into the formula:

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14 \sqrt{3})^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3 \]>>

### Step 5: Simplify the Area Calculation
Continue simplifying to find the area of $\triangle ABC$:

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588\
A = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4}

\[ A = 147 \sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the area of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ is \(147 \sqrt{3}\).>>

Viviani's Theorem states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from a point inside an equilateral triangle to the three sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle. This can simplify finding the side length or area of the triangle.

Let:
- The side length of equilateral triangle $ABC$ be $s$.
- The altitude of triangle $ABC$ be $h$.
Step 2:

With the perpendicular distances provided, which are 8, 6, and 7, use Viviani's Theorem.

\[ 8 + 6 + 7 = h \]

Calculating the above gives:

\[ h = 21 \]

This is the altitude of the original equilateral triangle $ABC$.
Step 3:
### Step 3: Calculate the Side Length $s$
The formula for the altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle in terms of its side length $s$ is:

\[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]

Using this relation:

\[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]

Solve for $s$ by multiplying both sides by \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\):

\[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14 \sqrt{3} \]
Step 4:
### Step 4: Apply the Area Formula for an Equilateral Triangle
The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]

Substitute \( s = 14 \sqrt{3} \) into the formula:

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14 \sqrt{3})^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3 \]
Step 5:
### Step 5: Simplify the Area Calculation
Continue simplifying to find the area of $\triangle ABC$:

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588\
A = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4}
