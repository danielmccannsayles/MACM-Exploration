Step 1:
**Step 1: Understanding the Setup and Known Formulas**
- You are given an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with a point $P$ inside it.
- $P$ has perpendicular distances to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ as 8, 6, and 7, respectively.
- To find the area of $\triangle ABC$, recall that in equilateral triangles, the area can be expressed using side length $s$ as:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
  \]
Step 2:

**Step 2: Applying Viviani's Theorem**
- Viviani's theorem states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of an equilateral triangle is constant and equal to the altitude of the triangle.
- Calculate the total sum of given distances:
  \[
  d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21
  \]
- Since 21 is also the altitude of triangle $ABC$, we can use this information moving forward.
Step 3:

**Step 3: Relationship between Altitude and Side Length**
- The altitude of an equilateral triangle can be expressed as:
  \[
  h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s
  \]
- Set this equal to the sum of perpendiculars using Viviani’s result:
  \[
  \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21
  \]
- Solving for $s$, multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \) to solve for $s$:
  \[
  s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} 
  \]
Step 4:

**Step 4: Simplifying the Side Length**
- Rationalize the side length $s$:
  \[
  s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}
  \]
- Now that the side length $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ has been found, this will help compute the area of triangle $ABC$ using the formula derived in Step 1.
Step 5:

**Step 5: Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**
- Substituting $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the area formula:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2
  \]
- Simplify the expression:
  \[\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3 = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4}
  \]
- Further simplification gives:
  \[\text{Area} = 147\sqrt{3}
