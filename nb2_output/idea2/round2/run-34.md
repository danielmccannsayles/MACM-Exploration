- Area of $	riangle PBC$: \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times 6 = 3a \)

Verifying current step: 
**Step 4: Utilize Equal Angles and Simplifications**\
Since $ABC$ is equilateral, all sides are equal, hence $a = b = c$. Set these expressions equal to represent the entire area: 

\[4c + 3a + 3.5b = K\] 

Since $a = b = c$, combine terms:

Verifying current step: 
**Step 5: Compute the Area and Solve for Side Length**\
We know the sum of the area obtained is also given by \[ K = \frac{1}{2} (c)(c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\]

Equating both expressions for area:

\[10.5c = \frac{1}{2}(c)(c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) \Rightarrow 21 = \frac{c \sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Modify and solve for $c$:

\[42 = c\sqrt{3}\] 

\[c = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}\]

Now, calculate the area using this $c$:

\[K = \frac{1}{2}(14\sqrt{3})(14\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = 147\] 

Thus, the final area of triangle $ABC$ is \(147\).>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step intends to equate two different expressions for the area of the equilateral triangle $ABC$, and solve for the side length and subsequently the triangle's area. Let's verify this step:

1. **Rewrite Area Equation**: 
   - The area of an equilateral triangle is given by \( K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} c^2 \).
   - However, the expression used for one of the area calculations was \( \frac{1}{2}(c)(c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) \), which is incorrect.

   Correctly, the equation should express the area as \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} c^2 \), equaling to \( 10.5 c \).

2. **Equation Setup & Mistake**:
   - The equation set in the step is \( 21 = \frac{c \sqrt{3}}{2} \).
   - It misstates the simplified area formula wrongly turning it into \( \frac{c \sqrt{3}}{2} \) rather than \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} c^2 \).

3. **Solving Small Errors**:
   - Re-arranging correctly should achieve: 
      \[ 10.5c = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} c^2 \]
   - Rearrange to find: 
      \[ c^2 = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}c \rightarrow c^2 \sqrt{3} = 42c \] 
   - This simplies to: 
      \[ c = 24 \]

4. **Calculate Final Area Correctly**:
   - The correct side length should plugin into \( K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} c^2 \) and not the faulty equation shown.
   - Substituting \( c = 24 \) back in:
      \[ K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (24)^2 = 144 \sqrt{3} \approx 248.5 \approx 249 \]

**Conclusion**:
The current step contains a calculation mistake in setting up the area equation of an equilateral triangle. Therefore, it presents an incorrect final answer for both side length and area.
>> 
Fixed step: **Step 5: Compute the Area and Solve for Side Length**\
We need to equate the correct expression of the area of triangle $ABC$ using side $c$. The area of an equilateral triangle is given by:

\[ K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} c^2 \]

Equating this expression with our previous calculated expression for the area:

\[ 10.5c = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} c^2 \]

Solve this equation for \( c \) by rearranging:

\[ c^2 = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{c} \]

Multiply both sides by \( 4 \):

\[ 42c\sqrt{3} = c^2\sqrt{3} \]

From \( c^2\sqrt{3} = 42c\sqrt{3} \), divide both sides by \(\sqrt{3}\):

\[ c^2 = 42c \]

Thus, cancel a common factor of \( c \):

\[ c = 42 \]

Now, calculate the area using this \( c \):

\[ K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 42^2 \]

Simplify to find:

\[ K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 1764 = 441\sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the corrected final area of triangle $ABC$ is \( 441 \sqrt{3} \).>>

To progress further, note that for an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the standard formula for the area $K$ is:

Given our equation where $K = 10.5c$, substitute $s = c$:

\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times c^2 = 10.5c \]

Simplify and solve for $c$ by canceling $c$ on both sides (assuming $c \neq 0$):

\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times c = 10.5 \]

Multiply both sides by 4 to clear the fraction:

\[ \sqrt{3} \times c = 42 \]

Solve for $c$ by dividing both sides by $\sqrt{3}$:

\[ c = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Rationalize the denominator:

\[ c = \frac{42 \times \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3} \]

Now that we have $c$, substitute back into the area formula:

\[ K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]

Calculate $c^2$:

\[ (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 14^2 \times (\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588 \]

Calculate the area $K$:

\[ K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]

Simplify:

\[ K = 588 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \]

Divide $588$ by $4$:

\[ K = 147\sqrt{3} \]

Step 1:
**Step 1: Leverage Area Formulas**\
To find the area of triangle $ABC$, we can express it through the sum of areas of sub-triangles $PAB$, $PBC$, and $PCA$. The combined area of these sub-triangles must equal the area of $ABC$. Use the following formula for the area of a triangle using an altitude:

\[\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{altitude}\]
Step 2:
**Step 2: Assign Variables to Bases**\
Assign variables to represent the lengths of the bases over which points are dropped: $AB = c$, $BC = a$, and $CA = b$. This creates three equations for the areas of sub-triangles in terms of these variables using their given altitudes.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Calculate Sub-triangle Areas**\
Calculate the areas of sub-triangles using their respective altitudes:
- Area of $	riangle PAB$: \( \frac{1}{2} \times c \times 8 = 4c \)
- Area of $	riangle PBC$: \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times 6 = 3a \)
- Area of $	riangle PCA$: \( \frac{1}{2} \times b \times 7 = 3.5b \)

By adding these, we can equate them to the entire area of $\triangle ABC$ using the side-based expression.
Step 4:
**Step 4: Utilize Equal Angles and Simplifications**\
Since $ABC$ is equilateral, all sides are equal, hence $a = b = c$. Set these expressions equal to represent the entire area: 

\[4c + 3a + 3.5b = K\] 

Since $a = b = c$, combine terms:

\[ (4 + 3 + 3.5)c = 10.5c = K\] 

where $K$ is the area of $\triangle ABC$.
Step 5:
**Step 5: Express Total Area in Terms of a Side**

To progress further, note that for an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the standard formula for the area $K$ is:

\[ K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times s^2 \]

Given our equation where $K = 10.5c$, substitute $s = c$:

\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times c^2 = 10.5c \]

Simplify and solve for $c$ by canceling $c$ on both sides (assuming $c \neq 0$):

\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times c = 10.5 \]

Multiply both sides by 4 to clear the fraction:

\[ \sqrt{3} \times c = 42 \]

Solve for $c$ by dividing both sides by $\sqrt{3}$:

\[ c = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Rationalize the denominator:

\[ c = \frac{42 \times \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3} \]

Now that we have $c$, substitute back into the area formula:

\[ K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]

Calculate $c^2$:

\[ (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 14^2 \times (\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588 \]

Calculate the area $K$:

\[ K = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]

Simplify:

\[ K = 588 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \]

Divide $588$ by $4$:

\[ K = 147\sqrt{3} \]
