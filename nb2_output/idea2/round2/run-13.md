**Step 1: Explore the relationship between altitudes and area**

Given the altitudes from point $P$ to the sides of triangle $ABC$, let the perpendicular distances from $P$ to $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ be $d_{AB} = 8$, $d_{BC} = 6$, and $d_{CA} = 7$ respectively.

To find the area of $\triangle ABC$, note that it's initially unknown. However, consider the formula for the area of the triangle using perpendicular distances of a point from the sides:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \, (|d_{AB} \cdot BC + d_{BC} \cdot CA + d_{CA} \cdot AB|) \]>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step aims to establish a formula for the area of an equilateral triangle by using the perpendicular distances from an interior point. The area of a triangle given such distances from an interior point to its sides is indeed a known formula. However, the derived formula in this step is inaccurate for directly computing the triangle area based solely on interior point perpendiculars without consideration of side lengths. While it suggests a legitimate foundation for addressing the problem, it incorrectly prescribes the method of finding the area by merely summing products of perpendicular distances and treating them algebraically as segments, which is not feasible without additional geometric conditions or properties. Additionally, such area computation often uses a weighted sum involving the full side-length and the point distances, which isn't clearly incorporated here.>> 
Fixed step: **Step 1: Use Viviani's Theorem**

Given that point $P$ is inside an equilateral triangle $ABC$ and the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ are $d_{AB} = 8$, $d_{BC} = 6$, and $d_{CA} = 7$ respectively, we can apply Viviani's Theorem. 

According to Viviani's Theorem, for any point $P$ inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle. Thus, we have:

\[ d_{AB} + d_{BC} + d_{CA} = \text{altitude of } \triangle ABC. \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ 8 + 6 + 7 = 21. \]

This tells us that the altitude of the equilateral triangle is 21. The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle in terms of its altitude $h$ and side length $s$ is given by:

\[ A = \frac{s \cdot h}{2}. \]

Using the relationship between side length and altitude in an equilateral triangle, where $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$, we solve to find the side length:

\[ s = \frac{2h}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2 \cdot 21}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}. \]

Thus, the area of triangle $ABC$ is:

\[ A = \frac{s \cdot 21}{2} = \frac{14\sqrt{3} \cdot 21}{2} = 147\sqrt{3}. \]>>

We have our verified steps:==========
>> 
Step 1:
**Step 1: Use Viviani's Theorem**

Given that point $P$ is inside an equilateral triangle $ABC$ and the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ are $d_{AB} = 8$, $d_{BC} = 6$, and $d_{CA} = 7$ respectively, we can apply Viviani's Theorem. 

According to Viviani's Theorem, for any point $P$ inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle. Thus, we have:

\[ d_{AB} + d_{BC} + d_{CA} = \text{altitude of } \triangle ABC. \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ 8 + 6 + 7 = 21. \]

This tells us that the altitude of the equilateral triangle is 21. The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle in terms of its altitude $h$ and side length $s$ is given by:

\[ A = \frac{s \cdot h}{2}. \]

Using the relationship between side length and altitude in an equilateral triangle, where $h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$, we solve to find the side length:

\[ s = \frac{2h}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2 \cdot 21}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}. \]

Thus, the area of triangle $ABC$ is:

\[ A = \frac{s \cdot 21}{2} = \frac{14\sqrt{3} \cdot 21}{2} = 147\sqrt{3}. \]
Step 2:
**Step 2: Confirm the Side Length Calculations**

Now that we have the side length $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ derived from the altitude, let's verify this calculation using known relationships in an equilateral triangle. We used the formula for the side $s$ in terms of altitude $h$:

\[
  h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot s \\
  21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot s \\
  s = \frac{2 \cdot 21}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}.
\]

Therefore, the side length calculation agrees with the relationship, confirming that $s = 14\sqrt{3}$.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**

Using the side length $s$ obtained from Step 2, we can calculate the area of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side $s$ is given by:

\[
  A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot s^2.
\]

Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the formula:

\[
  A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot (14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot 588.
\]

Calculate the area:

\[
  A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot 588 = 147\sqrt{3}.
\]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Verify the Result with Alternative Method**

Another way to verify the result is by recalculating using the earlier formula involving altitude:

Recall:

\[
  A = \frac{s \cdot h}{2} = \frac{14\sqrt{3} \cdot 21}{2}.
\]

This again gives us the area:

\[
  A = 147\sqrt{3}.
\]

Both methods verify that the calculations are consistently leading to the same result.
