**Step 1: Introduce Key Concept - Viviani's Theorem**

Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the three sides of the triangle is equal to the length of the side of the triangle. Denote the side length of triangle $ABC$ as $s$. Thus, 

\[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = s \]

where $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$ are the distances from point $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$, respectively. Plug in the distances:

\[ 8 + 6 + 7 = s \] 

This simplifies to:

\[ s = 21 \]

So, the side length $s$ of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ is 21 units.
