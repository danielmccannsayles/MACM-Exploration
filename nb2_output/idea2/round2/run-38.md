Verifying current step: 
**Step 1: Understand the Structure**

- Point \(P\) is within an equilateral triangle \(ABC\).
- Three perpendiculars (altitudes) from \(P\) to the sides \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(CA\) have respective lengths of 8, 6, and 7.
- An equilateral triangle has all angles equal to 60° and sides of equal length.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Apply Viviani's Theorem**

Viviani's Theorem states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of an equilateral triangle is equal to the length of an altitude of the triangle.

- Therefore, \(8 + 6 + 7 = 21\) is equal to the altitude of triangle \(ABC\).
- Set \(h = 21\), where \(h\) represents the altitude of triangle \(ABC\).>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 3: Relate Altitude to Side Length**

The altitude \(h\) of an equilateral triangle is related to the side length \(s\) by:

\[
h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s
\]

- Substitute \(h = 21\) to find \(s\):  
\[
21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s
\]
\[
s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}\]

So, \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\) is the side length of triangle \(ABC\).>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 4: Calculate the Area of Triangle \(ABC\)**

The area \(A\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by:

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times s^2
\]
Substitute \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\) into the formula:

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2
\]
\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3}
\]

Therefore, \(A = 147\sqrt{3}\) square units.>>

Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the Structure**

- Point \(P\) is within an equilateral triangle \(ABC\).
- Three perpendiculars (altitudes) from \(P\) to the sides \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(CA\) have respective lengths of 8, 6, and 7.
- An equilateral triangle has all angles equal to 60° and sides of equal length.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Apply Viviani's Theorem**

Viviani's Theorem states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of an equilateral triangle is equal to the length of an altitude of the triangle.

- Therefore, \(8 + 6 + 7 = 21\) is equal to the altitude of triangle \(ABC\).
- Set \(h = 21\), where \(h\) represents the altitude of triangle \(ABC\).
Step 3:
**Step 3: Relate Altitude to Side Length**

The altitude \(h\) of an equilateral triangle is related to the side length \(s\) by:

\[
h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s
\]

- Substitute \(h = 21\) to find \(s\):  
\[
21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s
\]
\[
s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}\]

So, \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\) is the side length of triangle \(ABC\).
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the Area of Triangle \(ABC\)**

The area \(A\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\) is given by:

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times s^2
\]
Substitute \(s = 14\sqrt{3}\) into the formula:

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2
\]
\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3}
\]

Therefore, \(A = 147\sqrt{3}\) square units.
Step 5:
**Step 5: Verify and Conclude**

- Recheck calculations to ensure the side length calculation, and area formula substitution are correct.
- Conclude that the area of the equilateral triangle \(ABC\) is \(147\sqrt{3}\) square units.

This final verification step assures the alignment of mathematics logic with Viviani's theorem and geometric properties. Confirm all variables were substituted correctly and calculations were simplified accurately.>>
