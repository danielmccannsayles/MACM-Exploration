Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Relating Altitude to Area**
For an equilateral triangle, the area can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{altitude}
\]
Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, we can express the base in terms of the side length $s$:
\[
\text{Base} = s
\]
This allows us to formulize the area in terms of the side length and altitude.>>

**Step 3: Calculate Side Length**
We know the formula for altitude of an equilateral triangle in terms of its side $s$ is:
\[
\text{Altitude} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\times s
\]
Given altitude = 21, we can solve for $s$:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\times s = 21

For an equilateral triangle, the area can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{altitude}

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\times s = 21
