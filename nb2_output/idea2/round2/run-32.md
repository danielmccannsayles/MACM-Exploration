Verifying current step: 
**Step 1: Identify and Set the Problem Using Known Theorems**

The triangle involved is equilateral, which implies:
- All sides are of equal length.
- All internal angles are 60 degrees.

Given that the altitudes from point $P$ inside the triangle $ABC$ to its sides are $8$, $6$, and $7$, you can leverage these to apply Viviani's theorem, which states:

"In an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any internal point to the sides of the triangle is constant and equal to the altitude of the triangle."

Therefore, $8 + 6 + 7$ should equal the altitude of triangle $ABC$.>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Calculate the Constant Sum and Equate with Altitude**

First, calculate the sum of the three given perpendicular distances:
$$8 + 6 + 7 = 21.$$ 

From Viviani's theorem, the above sum must equal the altitude (height) $h$ of triangle $ABC$.
$$h = 21.$$>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 3: Use the Altitude Formula for Equilateral Triangle**

For an equilateral triangle with side $s$, the altitude $h$ is given by:
$$ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s.$$ 

Set the above expression equal to the known altitude, $21$:
$$ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s = 21.$$ 

Solve for $s$ (the side length):
$$ s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}.$$>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Equilateral Triangle**

The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is:
$$A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2.$$ 

Substitute the value of $s$:
$$ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2.$$ 

Simplify the expression:
$$ (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588. $$
$$ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588.$$>>

Calculate the final expression for the area:

1. Divide 588 by 4:
$$ A = \frac{\sqrt{3} \times 588}{4} = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4}.$$

"In an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any internal point to the sides of the triangle is constant and equal to the altitude of the triangle."

Therefore, $8 + 6 + 7$ should equal the altitude of triangle $ABC$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Calculate the Constant Sum and Equate with Altitude**

First, calculate the sum of the three given perpendicular distances:
$$8 + 6 + 7 = 21.$$ 

From Viviani's theorem, the above sum must equal the altitude (height) $h$ of triangle $ABC$.
$$h = 21.$$
Step 3:
**Step 3: Use the Altitude Formula for Equilateral Triangle**

For an equilateral triangle with side $s$, the altitude $h$ is given by:
$$ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s.$$ 

Set the above expression equal to the known altitude, $21$:
$$ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s = 21.$$ 

Solve for $s$ (the side length):
$$ s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}.$$
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Equilateral Triangle**

The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is:
$$A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2.$$ 

Substitute the value of $s$:
$$ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2.$$ 

Simplify the expression:
$$ (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588. $$
$$ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588.$$

**Step 5: Simplify to Find the Final Area**

Calculate the final expression for the area:

1. Divide 588 by 4:
$$ A = \frac{\sqrt{3} \times 588}{4} = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4}.$$ 

2. Simplify the division:
$$ A = 147\sqrt{3}. $$

The area of triangle $ABC$ is therefore $147\sqrt{3}$.>>
