    - Set the side length of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ to be $s$.
    - The area of an equilateral triangle with side $s$ is given by the formula $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2$.
    - The altitudes from point $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ are given as 8, 6, and 7, respectively.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Apply Viviani's Theorem**
    - Viviani’s theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances to the three sides is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle.
    - Therefore, we have:
      \[ h = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \]
    - This means the altitude of triangle $ABC$ is 21.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Relate Altitude to Side Length**
    - The altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle can also be expressed in terms of its side length $s$ as:
      \[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]
    - Set this equal to the sum of given altitudes which we found:
      \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21 \]

**Step 4: Solve for Side Length $s$**
    - Multiply both sides of the equation by $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$ to solve for $s$:
      \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]
    - Rationalize the denominator:
      \[ s = \frac{42 \times \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3} \]
Step 5:
**Step 5: Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**
    - Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2$:
      \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
    - Simplify the expression:
      \[ (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588 \]
    - Therefore, the area is:
      \[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3} \]
    - Hence, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $147\sqrt{3}$.>>
