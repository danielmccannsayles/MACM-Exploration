### Step 1: Understanding Viviani's Theorem
Viviani's Theorem states that for any interior point $P$ in an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle. Thus, for our problem, we have:

\[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = h \]

where:
- $d_1 = 8$, $d_2 = 6$, $d_3 = 7$ are the perpendiculars from $P$ to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ respectively. 

Therefore,

\[ 8 + 6 + 7 = h \]

\[ h = 21 \].

This is the height of the triangle $ABC$.>>

### Step 2: Find Side Length of the Triangle
The altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle with side $s$ is given by:

\[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]

Substitute $h = 21$ to find $s$:

\[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]

Solving for $s$:

\[ s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3} \]>>

### Step 3: Use the Side Length to Find the Area
The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 \]

Using $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]

Calculate $(14\sqrt{3})^2$:

\[ (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588 \]>>

### Step 4: Complete the Calculation for Area
Substitute the squared side value into the area formula:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]

\[ h = 21 \].

This is the height of the triangle $ABC$.
Step 2:
### Step 2: Find Side Length of the Triangle
The altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle with side $s$ is given by:

\[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]

Substitute $h = 21$ to find $s$:

\[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \]

Solving for $s$:

\[ s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3} \]
Step 3:
### Step 3: Use the Side Length to Find the Area
The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 \]

Using $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]

Calculate $(14\sqrt{3})^2$:

\[ (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588 \]
Step 4:
### Step 4: Complete the Calculation for Area
Substitute the squared side value into the area formula:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]

Simplify further:

\[ A = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3} \]
