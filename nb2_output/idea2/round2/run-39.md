**Step 3**: Apply Viviani's Theorem

Viviani's Theorem states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of an equilateral triangle equals the length of the altitude of the triangle.

For \(\triangle ABC\) with each side of length \(s\), the altitude is \(\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Therefore:
\[
8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\]
\[\ 21 = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2} \Rightarrow s \sqrt{3} = 42 \Rightarrow s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{1.732} \approx 24.25\]>>

Step 1:
**Step 1**: Understand the Setup

The problem provides that there is a point \(P\) within an equilateral triangle \(ABC\) and altitudes from \(P\) to sides \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(CA\) are 8, 6, and 7 respectively. These altitudes form perpendicular line segments from \(P\) to each side of the triangle \(ABC\). Consequently, these altitudes divide \(\triangle PAB\), \(\triangle PBC\), and \(\triangle PCA\) into right triangles with bases on the sides of \(\triangle ABC\).
Step 2:
**Step 2**: Use the Area Formulas for Each Sub-triangle

Each sub-triangle, \(\triangle PAB\), \(\triangle PBC\), and \(\triangle PCA\), contributes to the total area of \(\triangle ABC\). The area of each triangle (sub-triangle) can be calculated as:
- \(\text{Area of } \triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot h_a = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot 8 \)
- \(\text{Area of } \triangle PBC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot h_b = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot 6 \)
- \(\text{Area of } \triangle PCA = \frac{1}{2} \cdot CA \cdot h_c = \frac{1}{2} \cdot CA \cdot 7 \)

These sub-areas sum up to the area of \(\triangle ABC\).
Step 3:
**Step 3**: Apply Viviani's Theorem

Viviani's Theorem states that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of an equilateral triangle equals the length of the altitude of the triangle.

For \(\triangle ABC\) with each side of length \(s\), the altitude is \(\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Therefore:
\[
8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\]
\[\ 21 = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2} \Rightarrow s \sqrt{3} = 42 \Rightarrow s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{1.732} \approx 24.25\]
Step 4:
**Step 4**: Calculate the Side Length of the Triangle

Realizing \(s\sqrt{3} = 42\), we solve for \(s\):
\[
\text{So } s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 24.25
\]
Given our step 3 calculations, the side length \(s\) of the equilateral triangle is approximately 24.25 units.
Step 5:
**Step 5**: Calculate the Total Area

The total area of the equilateral triangle \(\triangle ABC\) can now be calculated using the standard formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:
- \(\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot s^2\)
  - Substitute \(s\) with 24.25:
\[\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot (24.25)^2 = \frac{1.732}{4} \cdot 588.0625 \approx 254.56\]
Thus, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is approximately 254.56 square units.>> 
And our Final Answer
The area of triangle \(ABC\) is approximately 254.56 square units.
