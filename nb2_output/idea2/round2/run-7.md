**Step 1:** Understand the Problem

We need to find the area of an equilateral triangle $ABC$ given that a point $P$ inside it has altitudes to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ with lengths 8, 6, and 7 respectively. In an equilateral triangle, the distance from a point inside to the three sides are known as its pedal distances.>>

Verifying current step: 

**Step 2: Relate Pedal Distances to Triangle Area**

Use Viviani's Theorem, which applies to equilateral triangles and states that the sum of the pedal distances from a point inside the triangle to its sides equals the length of the altitude of the triangle.

- Let $a$ be the side length of triangle $ABC$. The altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle is given by:\( h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a \).
- According to Viviani's Theorem: $8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a$.

- Simplifying: 
  \( 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a \).>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 3: Solve for the Side Length $a$**

- Multiply both sides of the equation \(21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a\) by \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\) to isolate $a$:

\(
a = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}}\).

- Rationalize the denominator:
  \(
a = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}\).

- Thus, the side length $a$ of triangle $ABC$ is \(14\sqrt{3}\).>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 4: Calculate the Altitude of the Triangle**

- We know the altitude $h$ in terms of $a$ from earlier:
  \(h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a\).

- Substitute the value of $a = 14\sqrt{3}$:
  \(h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}}{2} \times 14\).

- Simplify:
  \(h = \frac{3}{2} \times 14 = 21\).>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 5: Compute the Area of Triangle $ABC$**

- The area $A$ of a triangle is given by \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).

- For our equilateral triangle:
  The base is the side $a = 14\sqrt{3}$ and the height is $21$.

- Compute the area:
  \(
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} \times 21\).

- Simplify:
  \(A = 7 \times 21 \times \sqrt{3} = 147\sqrt{3}\).

- Hence, the area of triangle $ABC$ is \(147\sqrt{3}\) square units.>>

Step 1:
**Step 1:** Understand the Problem

We need to find the area of an equilateral triangle $ABC$ given that a point $P$ inside it has altitudes to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ with lengths 8, 6, and 7 respectively. In an equilateral triangle, the distance from a point inside to the three sides are known as its pedal distances.
Step 2:

**Step 2: Relate Pedal Distances to Triangle Area**

Use Viviani's Theorem, which applies to equilateral triangles and states that the sum of the pedal distances from a point inside the triangle to its sides equals the length of the altitude of the triangle.

- Let $a$ be the side length of triangle $ABC$. The altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle is given by:\( h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a \).
- According to Viviani's Theorem: $8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a$.

- Simplifying: 
  \( 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a \).
Step 3:
**Step 3: Solve for the Side Length $a$**

- Multiply both sides of the equation \(21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a\) by \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\) to isolate $a$:

\(
a = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}}\).

- Rationalize the denominator:
  \(
a = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}\).

- Thus, the side length $a$ of triangle $ABC$ is \(14\sqrt{3}\).
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the Altitude of the Triangle**

- We know the altitude $h$ in terms of $a$ from earlier:
  \(h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a\).

- Substitute the value of $a = 14\sqrt{3}$:
  \(h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}}{2} \times 14\).

- Simplify:
  \(h = \frac{3}{2} \times 14 = 21\).
Step 5:
**Step 5: Compute the Area of Triangle $ABC$**

- The area $A$ of a triangle is given by \(A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).

- For our equilateral triangle:
  The base is the side $a = 14\sqrt{3}$ and the height is $21$.

- Compute the area:
  \(
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} \times 21\).

- Simplify:
  \(A = 7 \times 21 \times \sqrt{3} = 147\sqrt{3}\).

- Hence, the area of triangle $ABC$ is \(147\sqrt{3}\) square units.>>
