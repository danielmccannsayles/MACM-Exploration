Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand Viviani's Theorem**  
Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides equals the altitude of the triangle.
  - Triangle $ABC$ is equilateral, so we can use Viviani's Theorem which implies:
  \[ x + y + z = h \]
  where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are the heights from point $P$ to $\,\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{CA}$ respectively, and $h$ is the altitude of triangle $ABC$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Apply Viviani's Theorem to the Given Lengths**  
Given the altitudes from $P$ to the sides of triangle $ABC$ as $8, 6, 7$, we sum these up:
  \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \]
  Thus, the total represents the altitude of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Therefore, $h = 21$.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Relate Altitude to Side Length in an Equilateral Triangle**  
In an equilateral triangle:
  \[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot s \]
  where $s$ is the side length of the triangle. Using the altitude $h = 21$, we can solve for $s$.
  \[
  21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \\
  s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}
  \]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Equilateral Triangle**  
The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle can be found using:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
  Substituting $s = 14\sqrt{3}$, we get:
  \[
  A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \left(14\sqrt{3}\right)^2 \\
  A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \\
  A = 147\sqrt{3}
  \]
Step 5:
**Step 5: Conclude with the Area Calculation**
Thus, the area of triangle $ABC$ is:
  \[\boxed{147\sqrt{3}} \]  
This value neatly matches our calculations based on the placement of point $P$ inside the triangle and the applicability of Viviani's Theorem.>> 
And our Final Answer
\[\boxed{147\sqrt{3}} \]
