**Step 3: Solve for the side length $s$ of triangle $ABC$.**

From the equation above, solve for $s$:
\[ s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}. \]
To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{3}$:
\[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}. \]>>
