 - Since the sum of the distances equals the triangle's altitude, set up the equation:
   
  $$h_{AB} + h_{BC} + h_{CA} = H,$$
   
  where $H = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s$.

**Step 3: Solve for the Side Length $s$**
 - Calculate the sum of the distances:
   
  $$8 + 6 + 7 = 21.$$
 - Set this equal to the triangle's altitude expression:
   
  $$21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s.$$ 
 - Solve for $s$:
   
  $$s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}.$$

Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the Geometry Involved**
 - Consider an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side length $s$ and a point $P$ inside the triangle. Given are the perpendicular distances from point $P$ to the sides of the triangle: $h_{AB} = 8$, $h_{BC} = 6$, and $h_{CA} = 7$.
 - Note that in an equilateral triangle, the sum of distances from an interior point to the three sides is constant and equal to the altitude $H$ of the equilateral triangle.
 - The altitude $H$ of an equilateral triangle with side $s$ is calculated using the formula $H = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Set Up the Equation for the Altitude of Triangle $ABC$**
 - Since the sum of the distances equals the triangle's altitude, set up the equation:
   
  $$h_{AB} + h_{BC} + h_{CA} = H,$$
   
  where $H = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s$.
 - Substitute the given distances into the equation:
   
  $$8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s.$$
Step 3:
**Step 3: Solve for the Side Length $s$**
 - Calculate the sum of the distances:
   
  $$8 + 6 + 7 = 21.$$
 - Set this equal to the triangle's altitude expression:
   
  $$21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s.$$ 
 - Solve for $s$:
   
  $$s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}.$$ 
 - Rationalize the denominator:
   
  $$s = \frac{42 \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14 \sqrt{3}.$$
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**
 - Use the area formula for an equilateral triangle, $A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2$.
 - Substitute $s = 14 \sqrt{3}$ into the area formula:
   
  $$A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14 \sqrt{3})^2.$$
 - Simplify the expression: 
   
  $$A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588$$ (since $(14 \sqrt{3})^2 = 588$)
   
  $$A = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 147 \sqrt{3}.$$
Step 5:
**Step 5: Conclude with the Final Area Calculation**
