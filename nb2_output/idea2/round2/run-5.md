**Step 2:** Using Viviani's Theorem

- Viviani's Theorem states that for any point within an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from that point to the sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
- Let $h$ be the altitude of triangle $ABC$. According to Viviani's theorem:
  \( h = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 \)
- This means the length of the altitude of $\triangle ABC$ is 21.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 3:** Express the Altitude in Terms of Side Length

- We know the formula for the altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is \( h = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \).
- Set \( \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} = 21 \) to find $s$:
  \[ \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} = 21 \]
- Solving for $s$, multiply both sides by 2:
  \[ s \sqrt{3} = 42 \]
- Divide by $\sqrt{3}$:
  \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42 \times \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14 \sqrt{3} \]>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 4:** Calculate Area of Equilateral Triangle

- The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle can be found using the formula:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times s^2 \]
- Plug in $s = 14 \sqrt{3}$:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14 \sqrt{3})^2 \]
- Calculate:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3 \]
- Simplify:
  \[ A = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 147 \sqrt{3} \]>>
