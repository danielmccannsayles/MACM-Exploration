Verifying current step: 
**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Information**  
- We are given an equilateral triangle $ABC$. Equilateral means all sides and angles are equal.

- Our goal is to find the area of triangle $ABC$.>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Use the Property of Altitudes from Internal Points**  
- In any triangle, when you have a point inside, and you draw perpendiculars (altitudes) from this point to the sides of the triangle, the sum of the products of the side lengths and the corresponding altitudes equals the total area of the triangle.
- Therefore, if $s$ is the side length of the equilateral triangle, the formula is:
  \[ s \cdot 8 + s \cdot 6 + s \cdot 7 = \text{Area of } \triangle ABC \] 
  \[ 21s = \text{Area of } \triangle ABC \]>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step is using a correct property about altitudes from an internal point in any triangle but needs clarity regarding the particular property for equilateral triangles. This step indicates that the sum of the products of the side length multiplied by each altitude equals the total area of the triangle, which mistakenly assumes equal weighting in the sum without proper derivation.  

Here's how we investigate the correctness:

1. **Context Understanding**: The original principle being outlined is a known result specifically appearing in discussions around centroids and specific named theorems like Viviani's theorem.  
   - Viviani's theorem states that in an **equilateral triangle**, the sum of perpendicular distances from an internal point to the sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle. This property indirectly relates to the calculations of areas using altitudes and balancing components.

2. **Step Evaluation**: The step suggests: 
   - Finding the area by using the equality: \( 21s = \text{Area of } \triangle ABC \).
   
But this step does not appropriately apply the principles for equilateral triangles which rely more naturally on Viviani’s Theorem directly rather than multiplying each altitude directly with the full side length before summation. It mistakes the use of the equilateral triangle's symmetry principles.

3. **Missing Details**: Coordinates will need consideration using derived symmetry if addressing this equilateral case directly:
   - For equilateral triangles, establishing known geometric proportions uses height or coordinate analysis for verification, potentially recasting each contributing part into the acquainted symmetrical framework.

**Conclusion**:
- The principle may align at some interim result for more general triangle applications under correct specific conditions, but the explicit direct attempt here misconceives standard symmetry calculated applications for equilateral interpretation straightforwardly.
>> 
Fixed step: **Step 2: Use the Property of Altitudes in Viviani's Theorem**  
- In an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any internal point to the sides is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle.
- Therefore, for equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side length $s$, the altitude is given by \( \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \).
- The sum of the given altitudes from $P$ to the sides of the triangle is 8 + 6 + 7 = 21.
- By Viviani’s theorem:
  \[ \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} = 21 \]
- Solving for $s$:
  - \( s \sqrt{3} = 42 \)
  - \( s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \)
- Now, find the area of triangle $ABC$ using side length $s$:
  \[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
  \[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
  \[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3 \]
  \[ = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} \]
  \[ = 147\sqrt{3} \]>>

We have our verified steps:==========
>> 
Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Information**  
- We are given an equilateral triangle $ABC$. Equilateral means all sides and angles are equal. 
- Inside this triangle, there's a point $P$ from which altitudes are drawn to $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ with lengths 8, 6, and 7, respectively.
- Our goal is to find the area of triangle $ABC$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Use the Property of Altitudes in Viviani's Theorem**  
- In an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any internal point to the sides is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle.
- Therefore, for equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side length $s$, the altitude is given by \( \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \).
- The sum of the given altitudes from $P$ to the sides of the triangle is 8 + 6 + 7 = 21.
- By Viviani’s theorem:
  \[ \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} = 21 \]
- Solving for $s$:
  - \( s \sqrt{3} = 42 \)
  - \( s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \)
- Now, find the area of triangle $ABC$ using side length $s$:
  \[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
  \[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
  \[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3 \]
  \[ = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} \]
  \[ = 147\sqrt{3} \]
Step 3:
**Step 3: Verify Dimensions and Simplify Using Known Geometry**
- Reconfirm that the calculated side length $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ is consistent by checking practical application against geometric principles.
- For an equilateral triangle, the radius of the circumcircle, $R$, encapsulates this triangle and is related to the side length $s$ by:
  \[ R = \frac{s}{\sqrt{3}} \]
- Confirm that resolving $s$ through Viviani's theorem provides a reasonable magnitude compared to other derived measurements (e.g., circumradius $R$ or the known base-height relationships within the unit framework for such triangles).
Step 4:
**Step 4: Confirm Area Calculation with Base and Height Approach**
- Reiterate the calculated area, confirming consistency using the height derived alongside Viviani's theorem.
- For other insight, represent the equilateral triangle's altitude $h$:
  \[ h = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2} = 21 \text{ units (determined earlier)}\]
- Ensure accuracy in substitution:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \\
  = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{s^2\sqrt{3}}{4}\]
- Substitute calculated side length:
  \[ = \frac{(14\sqrt{3})^2 \times \sqrt{3}}{4} = 147\sqrt{3}\
  = \text{Confirmed area using base-height representation.}
  \]
Step 5:
**Step 5: Recheck and Present Final Solution**
- After confirming via both Viviani's theorem and geometric area derivatives, finalize the area of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ as consistent with prior calculations. 
- Easy verification comes by reviewing:
  - Given distances, recount through trigonometric or altitudinal properties for an equilateral triangle for further assurance.
  - Surface any extraneous calculations or considerations necessary beyond given constraints to double-check solution.
