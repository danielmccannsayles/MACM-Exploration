**Step 1: Understanding Viviani's Theorem**
Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides of the triangle is equal to the altitude of the triangle.

In this problem, Point $P$ is inside the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Thus, according to Viviani's Theorem, the sum of the altitudes from point $P$ to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ can be written as:

\[ h_{PA} + h_{PB} + h_{PC} = h \]

Where $h_{PA} = 8$, $h_{PB} = 6$, and $h_{PC} = 7$. Subsequently:

\[ 8 + 6 + 7 = h \]

Thus, the total height $h = 21$ units.>>

**Step 2: Establish Basic Equilateral Triangle Properties**
In an equilateral triangle, the altitude is also the median and the angle bisector. Given that the altitude we calculated using Viviani's Theorem equals $21$, this is the complete height from one vertex perpendicular to the opposite side.

Let the side length of triangle $ABC$ be $s$. The altitude of an equilateral triangle can also be expressed as \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \). So we have:

\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21 \]>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 3: Solve for the Side Length s**
Given the expression derived from the altitude formula:

\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21 \]

Let's solve for $s$:

Multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \):

\[ s = 21 \times \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Rationalize the denominator:

\[ s = \frac{42 \times \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3} \]>>

**Step 4: Calculate the Area of Triangle using the Side Length**
The formula to calculate the area \( A \) of an equilateral triangle is:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]

Let's use the side length $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:

\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]

Calculate the square of the side length:

\[ (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588 \]

Where $h_{PA} = 8$, $h_{PB} = 6$, and $h_{PC} = 7$. Subsequently:

\[ 8 + 6 + 7 = h \]

Thus, the total height $h = 21$ units.
Step 2:

In an equilateral triangle, the altitude is also the median and the angle bisector. Given that the altitude we calculated using Viviani's Theorem equals $21$, this is the complete height from one vertex perpendicular to the opposite side.

Let the side length of triangle $ABC$ be $s$. The altitude of an equilateral triangle can also be expressed as \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \). So we have:

Step 3:
**Step 3: Solve for the Side Length s**
Given the expression derived from the altitude formula:

\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21 \]

Let's solve for $s$:

Multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \):

\[ s = 21 \times \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Rationalize the denominator:

\[ s = \frac{42 \times \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3} \]
