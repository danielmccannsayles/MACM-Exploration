Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides of the triangle equals the length of the triangle's altitude. Hence, if $P$ is a point inside an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with distances 8, 6, and 7 from sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$, respectively, then:

Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Set Up Viviani's Equation**
Insert the given distances into Viviani’s equation:

Verifying current step: 
**Step 3: Relate Altitude and Side Length** 
The altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle is related to its side length $s$ by the formula:
\[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s \]
Using the value of $h = 21$ from Step 2, you can solve for $s$:
\[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s \]
Solve for $s$:
\[ s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} \]
Rationalize the denominator:
\[ s = \frac{42 \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14 \sqrt{3} \]>>

**Step 4: Calculate the Area Using Side Length**
The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by:
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (196 \times 3) \]
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
\[ A = 147 \sqrt{3} \]>>

Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand Viviani's Theorem**  
Viviani's Theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides of the triangle equals the length of the triangle's altitude. Hence, if $P$ is a point inside an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with distances 8, 6, and 7 from sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$, respectively, then:
\[ d_{AB} + d_{BC} + d_{CA} = h \]
Where $d_{AB}, d_{BC}, d_{CA}$ are the distances from $P$ to sides $AB, BC, CA$, and $h$ is the altitude of $\triangle ABC$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Set Up Viviani's Equation**
Insert the given distances into Viviani’s equation:
\[ 8 + 6 + 7 = h \]
\[ h = 21 \]
So, the altitude of $\triangle ABC$ is 21 units.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Relate Altitude and Side Length** 
The altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle is related to its side length $s$ by the formula:
\[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s \]
Using the value of $h = 21$ from Step 2, you can solve for $s$:
\[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s \]
Solve for $s$:
\[ s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} \]
Rationalize the denominator:
\[ s = \frac{42 \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14 \sqrt{3} \]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the Area Using Side Length**
The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by:
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (196 \times 3) \]
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
\[ A = 147 \sqrt{3} \]

**Step 5: Verify and Conclude**
Double-check calculations:
- Sum of distances: $8 + 6 + 7 = 21$
- Relation of altitude and side length: $h = 21$ satisfies Viviani’s Theorem
- We've used $s=14\sqrt{3}$ to find the area, confirming calculations are aligned. 
Thus, the area of triangle $ABC$ is:
