- **Properties:** We have altitudes from $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ as 8, 6, and 7, respectively.
- **Objective:** Find the area of the triangle $ABC$.

In an equilateral triangle, each of the segments (altitudes) falls appropriately from $P$ on its corresponding side.
Step 2:
### Step 2: Leveraging Viviani's Theorem
- **Viviani's Theorem:** In an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any internal point to the sides is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle.
- **Expression:** Hence, $h$ (altitude of the triangle $ABC$) = 8 + 6 + 7.
- **Calculate:** $h = 21$.

This provides the altitude of the entire equilateral triangle through the application of Viviani's Theorem.

- **Substitute $h$ from Step 2:** $21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s$.
- **Solve for $s$:**
  - $\frac{21}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{s}{2}$
  - $s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}$

Now we have the side length $s$ of equilateral triangle $ABC$.
