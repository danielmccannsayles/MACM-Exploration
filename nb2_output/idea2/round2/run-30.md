Verifying current step: 
**Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Altitudes**
- Recognize that the altitudes from point $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ effectively form perpendicular heights from $P$ to the lines containing these sides.
- Let the distances from $P$ to $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ be denoted by $d_1 = 8$, $d_2 = 6$, and $d_3 = 7$ respectively.
- A key property of equilateral triangles is that any point inside the triangle has the sum of the perpendicular distances equal to the altitude of the triangle. Namely:   
  \[\frac{d_1 + d_2 + d_3}{2} = h \] where $h$ is the altitude of the equilateral triangle $ABC$.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: To verify the correctness of this step, we need to analyze the statement that for any point \( P \) inside an equilateral triangle \( ABC \), the sum of the perpendicular distances (altitudes) from \( P \) to the sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) is equal to the altitude (\( h \)) of the triangle. The equation given 

\[ \frac{d_1 + d_2 + d_3}{2} = h \]

implies that the sum of these distances is twice the altitude. 

### Verification:
1. **Proper understanding of key properties**: The claim is based on the known fact about points inside equilateral triangles where the sum of perpendicular distances from a point to the sides is constant.

2. **Equation mismatch**: The claim in the current step diverges from the correct understanding. The original relationship should be:
   
   \[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = h \]
   
   indicating that the sum of the distances is equal to the altitude of the triangle, not twice the altitude. This means the equation given in the current step is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The step contains an error in stating the relationship of distances to the altitude of an equilateral triangle.

Thus, the current step is **not correct**.>>
