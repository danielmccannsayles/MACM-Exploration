**Step 2: Express the Area of Sub-Triangles**

Use the formula for the area of a triangle when given a base and a corresponding height:
- $\text{Area of } \triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times 8$
- $\text{Area of } \triangle PBC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times 6$
- $\text{Area of } \triangle PCA = \frac{1}{2} \times CA \times 7$

Since $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, $AB = BC = CA$. Let the side length of the triangle be $s$. Thus, each of these areas can be expressed as fractional multiples of a common side length.>>

**Step 3: Formulate the Total Area Using a Known Theorem**

There is a useful relation, derived from known properties of concurrent medians in equilateral triangles, known as Viviani's Theorem - for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendiculars from the point to the sides equals the triangle's perpendicular height.

Given:
- Sum of given altitudes = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21

Relate this sum to the height of the triangle, which is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s$. Therefore,
$$21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s$$>>

Using the equation from Step 3,
- Solve for $s$: 
$$ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42 \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14 \sqrt{3}$$

Substitute $s$ into the formula for the area of equilateral triangle:
- Area = $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14 \sqrt{3})^2$
- Simplify: Area = $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588$

Fix the current step for reasoning: Upon reviewing the current step:

### Current Step Analysis:
- **Step 5:** Concludes that the area of equilateral triangle $ABC$ is 147 square units after calculations and simplifications from previous steps.

### Evaluation Criteria for Correctness:

1. **Verifying Calculation Consistency**:
   - Side length $s$ calculation from Viviani’s theorem is $s = 14\sqrt{3}$.
   - Verification of area calculation:
     - Use: Area of equilateral triangle formula, $A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$.
     - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$:
       \[
       s^2 = (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 588
       \]
     - Thus, \[
       \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = 147 \sqrt{3}
       \]
   - The above calculation aligns correctly with 147, but additional simplification for exact numerical area is needed.

2. **Step's Incorrect Conclusion**:
   - While the numerical result 147 was concluded, it reflects a specific number without complete dimensional units assistance or specific simplifications.
   - The actual calculation, overall verified with Viviani and area formulas, should render 147√3 or alternatively a numeric approximation depending on extraction expectations but overlooks complete contextual quantifier.

3. **Logical Clarity**:
   - Reasoning correctly implies appropriation from Viviani and traditional area definitions.
   - Requires consideration of complete dimensional exit and rounding aspects for end-user understanding or format consistency.

Overall, the conceptual flow identifies errors in the explicit ending statement or conclusion sphere, leading to misalignment of exact expression or output terms without rounding/extraction insights.>> 
Fixed step: **Step 5: Conclude the Calculation**

- The correct area of equilateral triangle $ABC$ is \( 147\sqrt{3} \) square units.

This result is consistent with the application of Viviani’s Theorem and the equilateral triangle area formula. Cross-verification confirms that using the derived side length \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \) leads to the final area calculation:

Step 1:
**Step 1: Understanding the Configuration and Conceptualizing Heron's Formula**

We are given an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with an internal point $P$. The main task is to find the area of triangle $ABC$ given the perpendicular distances from point $P$ to each side $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$.
Identify the concept:
- The given lengths are altitudes from point $P$ to the sides of the equilateral triangle, leading to forming three smaller triangles inside.
- Use concepts from computational geometry that involve arranging the piecewise areas of these smaller triangles to find the total area of $	riangle ABC$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Express the Area of Sub-Triangles**

Use the formula for the area of a triangle when given a base and a corresponding height:
- $\text{Area of } \triangle PAB = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times 8$
- $\text{Area of } \triangle PBC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times 6$
- $\text{Area of } \triangle PCA = \frac{1}{2} \times CA \times 7$

Since $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, $AB = BC = CA$. Let the side length of the triangle be $s$. Thus, each of these areas can be expressed as fractional multiples of a common side length.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Formulate the Total Area Using a Known Theorem**

There is a useful relation, derived from known properties of concurrent medians in equilateral triangles, known as Viviani's Theorem - for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendiculars from the point to the sides equals the triangle's perpendicular height.

Given:
- Sum of given altitudes = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21

Relate this sum to the height of the triangle, which is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s$. Therefore,
$$21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s$$
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate Side Length and Area of Triangle $ABC$**

Using the equation from Step 3,
- Solve for $s$: 
$$ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42 \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14 \sqrt{3}$$

Substitute $s$ into the formula for the area of equilateral triangle:
- Area = $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14 \sqrt{3})^2$
- Simplify: Area = $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588$
- Further simplification: Area = 147\sqrt{3}$
Step 5:
**Step 5: Conclude the Calculation**

After verifying the calculations and simplifications in the previous steps, we conclude:
- The correct area of equilateral triangle $ABC$ is \( 147\sqrt{3} \) square units.

This result is consistent with the application of Viviani’s Theorem and the equilateral triangle area formula. Cross-verification confirms that using the derived side length \( s = 14\sqrt{3} \) leads to the final area calculation: 

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 147\sqrt{3} \, \text{square units}.
\]>> 
And our Final Answer
\( 147\sqrt{3} \) square units.
