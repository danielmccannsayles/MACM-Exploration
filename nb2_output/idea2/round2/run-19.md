### Step 3: Relate Altitude to Side Length
- Next, relate the altitude $h$ to the side length $a$ of the triangle:
  \[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a \]
- Substitute the calculated altitude (21) into this equation:
  \[ 21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a \]
- Solve for $a$:
  \[ a = \frac{2 \times 21}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3} \]>>

  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 \]
- Substitute $a = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the formula:
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
  \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(196 \times 3) \]
