**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Problem**
- Point $P$ is within triangle $ABC$, forming perpendiculars (altitudes) to each of the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$. These altitudes are 8, 6, and 7 respectively.
- Knowing the properties of an equilateral triangle assists because the perpendicular distance from a point inside the triangle to a side falls within related formulas.>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Use Area Calculations through Altitudes**
- The sum of the areas formed by these altitudes from $P$ to the sides of the triangle gives the area of the triangle.
- Using the formula for the area of a triangle using a base and height, the area contributions from each of these altitudes are:
  - $\frac{1}{2} \times AB \times 8$
  - $\frac{1}{2} \times BC \times 6$
  - $\frac{1}{2} \times CA \times 7$>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step attempts to find the area of triangle $ABC$ by calculating the area contributions from each altitude with the formula for the area of a triangle (base * height / 2). However, it is incorrect as it assumes three separate triangles formed with $P$ as a common vertex provide the area of the entire triangle. 

In an equilateral triangle, the sum of these individual triangle areas using each perpendicular as a height does not necessarily directly give the area of the whole triangle unless further conditions between sides are integrated. This step misses recognizing a crucial relation or needs to employ alternative known properties or formulas such as equivalent areas due to equilateral symmetry.

Furthermore, specific relationships tying the side lengths to these particular altitudes in this arrangement, potentially involving the triangle's side length or alternative geometric properties, steps away from a straightforward combination of areas as proposed.

Overall, further justifications, derivations, or proofs are necessary to support or refute the proposed union of these areas forming the whole area of $\triangle ABC$ correctly.>> 
Fixed step: **Step 2: Relate Perpendicular Distances to the Area of Equilateral Triangle**

- For an equilateral triangle, the area can be derived considering the equidistant sum of perpendiculars inside.
- The area, in this special case, is $\frac{s}{2} \cdot (h_A + h_B + h_C)$, where $s$ is the side length of the triangle, and $h_A$, $h_B$, and $h_C$ are the perpendiculars from point $P$.
  
Given $h_A = 8$, $h_B = 6$, and $h_C = 7$, we compute:
- Sum of altitudes: $8 + 6 + 7 = 21$.

Using Viviani's Theorem for equilateral triangles:
- The sum of distances from any interior point to the three sides of an equilateral triangle equals the altitude of the triangle.
  
Thus, equating them to the triangle's altitude, calculate for $s$:
- Let the altitude of $\triangle ABC$ be $A$, then $21 = A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s$.
  
Solving for $s$, substitute back in the area formula:
- Area of $\triangle ABC = \frac{s}{2} \times 21$.

This correctly uses the geometry properties without disconnecting their symmetry and equating the individual contributions incorrectly.>>

Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Problem**
- Point $P$ is within triangle $ABC$, forming perpendiculars (altitudes) to each of the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$. These altitudes are 8, 6, and 7 respectively.
- Knowing the properties of an equilateral triangle assists because the perpendicular distance from a point inside the triangle to a side falls within related formulas.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Relate Perpendicular Distances to the Area of Equilateral Triangle**

- For an equilateral triangle, the area can be derived considering the equidistant sum of perpendiculars inside.
- The area, in this special case, is $\frac{s}{2} \cdot (h_A + h_B + h_C)$, where $s$ is the side length of the triangle, and $h_A$, $h_B$, and $h_C$ are the perpendiculars from point $P$.
  
Given $h_A = 8$, $h_B = 6$, and $h_C = 7$, we compute:
- Sum of altitudes: $8 + 6 + 7 = 21$.

Using Viviani's Theorem for equilateral triangles:
- The sum of distances from any interior point to the three sides of an equilateral triangle equals the altitude of the triangle.
  
Thus, equating them to the triangle's altitude, calculate for $s$:
- Let the altitude of $\triangle ABC$ be $A$, then $21 = A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s$.
  
Solving for $s$, substitute back in the area formula:
- Area of $\triangle ABC = \frac{s}{2} \times 21$.

This correctly uses the geometry properties without disconnecting their symmetry and equating the individual contributions incorrectly.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Solve for Side Length $s$ Using Viviani's Theorem**

- Recall from Viviani's Theorem, in any equilateral triangle, the sum of the distances from any internal point to its sides equals the altitude.
- Set $21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s$, as this represents the total height.

\[
21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s
\]

- Solve for $s$:

\[
s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14\sqrt{3}.
\]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the Altitude of Triangle $ABC$**

- With $s = 14\sqrt{3}$, calculate the altitude (height) of $\triangle ABC$.

- The formula for altitude $A$ of an equilateral triangle is $A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s$.

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} = \frac{3 \times 14}{2} = 21.
\]

- Verification: Our computation aligns perfectly with the Viviani's sum of 21, confirming our side length calculation.
Step 5:
**Step 5: Find the Area of Triangle $ABC$**

- Using the side length $s = 14\sqrt{3}$, calculate the area $A_{triangle}$:

- The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times s^2$.

\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = 147\sqrt{3}.
\]

- Therefore, the area of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ is $147\sqrt{3}$.>>
