Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Calculate the Side Length of Triangle $ABC$**  
To find the side length $s$ of the equilateral triangle, we use the formula for the altitude $h$ in terms of the side length:
\[
h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21
\]Solving for $s$:
\[
s = \frac{21 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}
\]To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{3}$:
\[
s = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}
