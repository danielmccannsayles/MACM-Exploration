Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the Problem**  
Given an equilateral triangle $ABC$ and point $P$ inside it such that the perpendiculars (altitudes) from $P$ to each side of the triangle are given as 8, 6, and 7, respectively. We need to calculate the area of triangle $ABC$. To do that, we'll use a known geometric property of equilateral triangles involving interior points and their perpendiculars.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Introduce Viviani's Theorem**  
Viviani's theorem will be helpful here. It states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from the point to the sides of the triangle is constant and equal to the triangle's altitude. Thus, for our point $P$ inside $\triangle ABC$, the sum of the given perpendiculars from $P$ to sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ will equal the height of $\triangle ABC$.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Calculate the Altitude of Triangle $ABC$**  
Use Viviani's theorem:  
Height of $\triangle ABC = 8 + 6 + 7 = 21$.  
So, the altitude of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ is 21. This relates to the side length using the formula for the altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$:  
\[ h = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \]
Setting $h = 21$, we solve:  
\[ 21 = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \]  
\[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14 \sqrt{3} \]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Determine the Side Length of Triangle $ABC**  
Having calculated the side length $s$ as $14 \sqrt{3}$, we now have all we need to find the area of triangle $ABC$. The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle is given by:  
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
Substitute $s = 14 \sqrt{3}$:  
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14 \sqrt{3})^2 \]  
Simplify further:  
\[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4} \]
Step 5:
**Step 5: Solve for the Area of Triangle $ABC**  
Final calculation to determine the area:  
\[ A = 147 \sqrt{3} \]  
Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $147 \sqrt{3}$ square units.
