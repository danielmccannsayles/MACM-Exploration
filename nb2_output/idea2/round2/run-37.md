Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Use Viviani's Theorem**
- According to Viviani's Theorem, in an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any internal point to the three sides is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle.
- Altitude $h_A$ of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side $s$ is given by:
  \[ h_A = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \]  
- Using Viviani's Theorem:  \[ h_1 + h_2 + h_3 = h_A \]  
- Therefore:
- \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \]>>

Verifying current step: 
**Step 3: Solve for the Side Length $s$**
- Simplify the equation obtained from Step 2:
  \[ 21 = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \]
- Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
  \[ 42 = s \sqrt{3} \]
- Isolate $s$ by dividing both sides by $\sqrt{3}$:
  \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]
- Rationalize $s$:
  \[ s = \frac{42 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14 \sqrt{3} \]>>

Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the Setup and Define Parameters**
- Point $P$ is an internal point of an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side length $s$.
- The perpendiculars from $P$ to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ are denoted as $h_1 = 8$, $h_2 = 6$, and $h_3 = 7$, respectively.

To solve the problem, we seek to find the area (denoted as $A$) of the triangle $ABC$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Use Viviani's Theorem**
- According to Viviani's Theorem, in an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any internal point to the three sides is equal to the length of the altitude of the triangle.
- Altitude $h_A$ of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side $s$ is given by:
  \[ h_A = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \]  
- Using Viviani's Theorem:  \[ h_1 + h_2 + h_3 = h_A \]  
- Therefore:
- \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \]
Step 3:
**Step 3: Solve for the Side Length $s$**
- Simplify the equation obtained from Step 2:
  \[ 21 = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} \]
- Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
  \[ 42 = s \sqrt{3} \]
- Isolate $s$ by dividing both sides by $\sqrt{3}$:
  \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]
- Rationalize $s$:
  \[ s = \frac{42 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14 \sqrt{3} \]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the Area of Triangle $ABC$**
- The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is:
  \[ A = \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} \]
- Substitute the value found for $s$ into the area formula:
  \[ A = \frac{(14 \sqrt{3})^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} \]
  \[ = \frac{196 \cdot 3 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{4} \]
  \[ = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4} \]
  \[ = 147 \sqrt{3} \]
