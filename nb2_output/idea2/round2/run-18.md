### Step 2: Relate the Problem to Viviani's Theorem
**Viviani's Theorem**: In an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
- In this problem, $\text{distance}(P, \overline{AB}) = 8$, $\text{distance}(P, \overline{BC}) = 6$, $\text{distance}(P, \overline{CA}) = 7$.

### Step 3: Relate to the Side Length and Overall Area
- For an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the altitude $h$ is given by:
  $$ h = \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} $$
- Using Viviani's Theorem, equate the sum of distances to the altitude, which gives:
  $$ \frac{s \sqrt{3}}{2} = 21 $$
- From here, solve for $s$: 
  $$ s \sqrt{3} = 42 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} $$>>

Verifying current step: 
### Step 4: Simplify the Side Length
- Simplify $s$: 
  $$ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = 14 \sqrt{3} $$  (rationalizing and simplifying)
- With $s = 14 \sqrt{3}$, we know the side length of the triangle.>>

### Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Triangle
- The area $A$ of an equilateral triangle is given by:
  $$ A = \frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} $$
- With $s = 14 \sqrt{3}$, substitute $s$ into the area formula:
  $$ A = \frac{(14 \sqrt{3})^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} $$
  $$ A = \frac{196 \times 3 \sqrt{3}}{4} $$ (since $s^2 = 196 \times 3$)
  $$ A = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4} $$
  $$ A = 147 \sqrt{3} $$
