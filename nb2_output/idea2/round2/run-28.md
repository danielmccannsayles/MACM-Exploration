This means in triangle $ABC$, the sum of distances from point $P$ to each side ($h_1$, $h_2$, $h_3$) gives us the altitude of equilateral triangle $ABC$:

$$h_1 + h_2 + h_3 = 	ext{Altitude of } \triangle ABC $$

**Step 2: Relate Altitude to Side Length in Equilateral Triangle**

The formula for the altitude ($h$) of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is:

$$h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$$

Substituting the altitude value from Step 1:

$$21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$$

The formula for the altitude ($h$) of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is:

$$h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$$

Substituting the altitude value from Step 1:

$$21 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$$

$$A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(14\sqrt{3})^2$$

Simplify inside the square:

$$(14\sqrt{3})^2 = 14^2 \times (\sqrt{3})^2 = 196 \times 3 = 588$$

Thus:

$$A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588$$
Step 4:
