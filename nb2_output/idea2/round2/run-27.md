Verifying current step: 
**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Set Up the Equilateral Triangle**  
- Recognize that point P inside triangle ABC has perpendicular distances to the sides AB, BC, and CA which are given as 8, 6, and 7 respectively.  
- Since triangle ABC is equilateral, each altitude of triangle ABC forms a smaller triangle with one of its sides. The sum of these smaller triangles' areas should equal the area of triangle ABC.>> 
Step was correct. Add to verified>> 
Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Concept of Area and Apollonius’s Theorem**  
- To solve this, use the concept that the area of triangle ABC can be expressed using the formula: \[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{side length} \times \text{altitude}\] 
- All three internal perpendiculars from point P can be considered as altitudes when considering triangles PAB, PBC, and PCA separately.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The step is trying to apply the formula for the area of a triangle to solve for the area of triangle ABC using the position of internal point P and its perpendiculars to the sides. By recognizing each perpendicular as an altitude of triangles PAB, PBC, and PCA respectively, the area of triangle ABC can be conceptually divided into three areas linked by these perpendiculars.

However, the step does not correctly convey the computation of the area of triangle ABC using the given altitudes. The formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{side length} \times \text{altitude} \) is true for each smaller triangle (PAB, PBC, PCA), but to find the total area of the equilateral triangle ABC directly, a different approach involving summing the individual areas formed by P and its perpendiculars should be used:

\[
\text{Total Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times (AB \cdot 8 + BC \cdot 6 + CA \cdot 7) = \frac{s}{2} (8 + 6 + 7)
\]  
where \( s \) is the side length of the equilateral triangle and the altitudes add directly because they are additive in calculating the total area of ABC.

As per Viviani's theorem, which is applicable because point P is inside an equilateral triangle: 
The sum of the perpendicular distances from any point inside an equilateral triangle to its sides is constant and equal to the altitude of the equilateral triangle.

Thus the step does not clearly provide a pathway to the solution using the correct additive property and setup.

Therefore, the reasoning in the current step is not fully correct for solving the problem.>> 
Fixed step: **Step 2: Calculate the Area of Triangle ABC Using the Perpendiculars**  
- The sum of the perpendicular distances from any point inside an equilateral triangle to its sides is constant and equal to the altitude of the equilateral triangle. 
- Since the perpendiculars from point P to the sides AB, BC, and CA are 8, 6, and 7 respectively, we have:  
  \[
  8 + 6 + 7 = 21.
  \]
- Therefore, the altitude of triangle ABC is 21. 
- The area \( A \) of the equilateral triangle ABC can be expressed as:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{side length} \times \text{altitude}.
  \]
- Given that the sum of the altitudes from point P equals the altitude of the whole triangle, calculate the side length \( s \) using the property there, specifically applying the comparison since sides remain equal:
  \[
  A = \frac{s}{2} \times 21.
  \]  
The area of triangle ABC can then be obtained if side length \( s \) is specifically calculated in further steps using known relationships or given values.>>
