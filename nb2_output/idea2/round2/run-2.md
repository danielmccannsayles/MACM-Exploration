**Step 1:** Apply Viviani's Theorem.

  - Viviani’s Theorem states that in an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of the triangle equals the altitude of the triangle. 
  - For triangle $ABC$ and interior point $P$, we know:
    \[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = h \]
  - Here, $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$ are 8, 6, and 7 respectively.

Verifying current step: 
**Step 2:** Use the relationship between side length and height in equilateral triangles.

  - Let the side length of the equilateral triangle be $s$. For equilateral triangles:
    \[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s \]
  - We now equate this to our calculated altitude:
    \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 21 \]
  - Solve for $s$:

Step 1:
**Step 1:** Apply Viviani's Theorem.

  - Viviani’s Theorem states that in an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the sides of the triangle equals the altitude of the triangle. 
  - For triangle $ABC$ and interior point $P$, we know:
    \[ d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = h \]
  - Here, $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$ are 8, 6, and 7 respectively.
  - Thus, \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = 21 = h \] is the height of triangle $ABC$.
Step 2:
**Step 2:** Use the relationship between side length and height in equilateral triangles.

  - Let the side length of the equilateral triangle be $s$. For equilateral triangles:
    \[ h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s \]
  - We now equate this to our calculated altitude:
    \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 21 \]
  - Solve for $s$:
    \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]
  - This simplifies to:
    \[ s = 14\sqrt{3} \]
Step 3:
**Step 3:** Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle.

  - The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is:
    \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
  - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the area formula:
    \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]
Step 4:
**Step 4:** Simplify the expression for the area.

  - Calculate the square of the side length:
    \[ (14\sqrt{3})^2 = 14^2 \times 3 = 196 \times 3 = 588 \]
  - Substitute back into the area formula:
    \[ A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
  - Simplify the expression:
    \[ A = \frac{588\sqrt{3}}{4} \]
  - This further simplifies to:
    \[ A = 147\sqrt{3} \]
Step 5:
**Step 5:** Conclusion.

  - Therefore, based on the calculations we derived, the area of triangle $ABC$ is:
    \[ \boxed{147\sqrt{3}} \]>> 
And our Final Answer
\[ \boxed{147\sqrt{3}} \]
