- Also, due to the properties of equilateral triangles, the area $A_{ABC}$ can be calculated using $A_{ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Analyze Altitude Relations Inside the Triangle**
- Given are the distances from point $P$ to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ as 8, 6, and 7 respectively. 
- These distances are the perpendicular heights from $P$ to the respective sides of the triangle. 
- Due to the nature of equilateral triangles, the sum of the altitudes from any interior point to the sides equals the altitude from any vertex. Therefore,
  \[ h_{AB} + h_{BC} + h_{CA} = \text{Altitude from any vertex} \] 
  \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = h_{vertex} \]
Step 3:
**Step 3: Calculate the Altitude of Triangle $ABC$**
- The total altitude from any vertex, found in the previous step, is 21.
- This must correspond to the altitude from a vertex through the centroid, which can also be calculated using the formula for an equilateral triangle:
  \[ h_{vertex} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s \] 
- Equating this to 21 gives us:
  \[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21 \]
  \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]
Step 4:
**Step 4: Simplify the Side Length Expression** 
- Rationalize and simplify to find $s$:
  \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = 42 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \]
  \[ s = 14\sqrt{3} \] 
- Now that the side length $s$ is known, proceed to compute the area.
Step 5:
**Step 5: Compute the Area of Triangle $ABC$**
- Use the area formula for equilateral triangles with the found side length:
  \[ A_{ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
  \[ A_{ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14\sqrt{3})^2 \]  
  \[ A_{ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3 \]
  \[ A_{ABC} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
  \[ A_{ABC} = \frac{1764}{4} \]
  \[ A_{ABC} = 441 \] 
Thus, the area of triangle $ABC$ is 441 square units.>>
