### Step 1: Understanding the Problem Setup
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the setup. We have an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with point $P$ inside it. The distances from $P$ to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ are given as altitudes from $P$ with lengths 8, 6, and 7, respectively. Recall that these altitudes are perpendicular from $P$ to each side.

Verifying current step: 
### Step 2: Setting Up the Altitude Relationship with Area
The sum of the areas of the smaller triangles $ABP$, $BCP$, and $CAP$ formed inside triangle $ABC$ must equal the area of $ABC$:  
- Area of $ABP$ = $\frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot 8$
- Area of $BCP$ = $\frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot 6$
- Area of $CAP$ = $\frac{1}{2} \cdot CA \cdot 7$
  
Since $ABC$ is equilateral, we set $AB = BC = CA = s$. Hence, the expressions simplify to:  
- $\frac{1}{2} s \times 8$
- $\frac{1}{2} s \times 6$
- $\frac{1}{2} s \times 7$>>

### Step 3: Calculating the Total Area from Internal Points
These three different sub-area components add to:  
- $\frac{1}{2}(8s + 6s + 7s) = \frac{1}{2}(21s)$
  
Thus, the total area of the triangle $ABC$, if calculated by adding sub-triangle areas, is  
$\frac{21}{2} s$.>> 
Fix the current step for reasoning: The current step involves calculating the total area of triangle $ABC$ by summing up the areas of the three smaller triangles ($ABP$, $BCP$, and $CAP$), which have been expressed in terms of $s$, the common side length of the equilateral triangle $ABC$.

### Verification
1. **Expression of Sub-Area Components:**
   - The expression correctly adds the three components from Step 2: 
     - $
      \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8s = 4s
      $
     - $
      \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6s = 3s
      $
     - $
      \frac{1}{2} \cdot 7s = 3.5s
      $

2. **Sum of Sub-Area Components:**
   - The calculation adds up these components correctly:
     - $4s + 3s + 3.5s = 10.5s$
   
3. **Final Expression for Total Area:**
   - The current step claims $
    \frac{1}{2}(21s) = \frac{21}{2}s 
    $ is the area of triangle $ABC$.
   
4. **Assessment of Final Expression:**
   - The step mistakenly doubled the correct sum of the sub-area components:
     - The accurate addition should've computed $
      10.5s
      $ instead.
   - Therefore, the correct area expression should be $10.5s = \frac{21}{2}s$
     
5. **Conclusion:**
   - The current step mistakenly presents the total area as $\frac{21}{2}s$ instead of the calculated sum of sub-areas $10.5s$, resulting from a miscalculation.

The area computation in the current step is incorrect based on the detailed evaluation.>> 
Fixed step: ### Step 3: Calculating the Total Area from Internal Points

These three different sub-area components add up to:

- $\frac{1}{2}(8s) + \frac{1}{2}(6s) + \frac{1}{2}(7s) = 4s + 3s + 3.5s = 10.5s$

Thus, the total area of triangle $ABC$, calculated by summing the sub-triangle areas, is $10.5s$.>>

### Step 4: Equating Areas to Find Side Length
Since the total area of triangle $ABC$ must be equal to the area calculated by summing up the altitudes to each side, we use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:  
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]

Setting this equal to the expression we derived from the sum of the partitioned areas:
\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = 10.5s \]

Now, simplify and solve for $s$ (the common side length):  
\[ \sqrt{3} s^2 = 42s \]
\[ s(\sqrt{3} s - 42) = 0 \]

Since $s = 0$ is not a valid length, we solve the equation:
\[ \sqrt{3} s = 42 \]
\[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Rationalize the denominator and simplify:
\[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = 14 \sqrt{3} \]>>

### Step 5: Finding the Final Area of Triangle $ABC$
With the side length $s$ now known:
\[ s = 14 \sqrt{3} \]

We can plug this back into the area formula for the equilateral triangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
Substitute $s = 14 \sqrt{3}$:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14 \sqrt{3})^2 \]
\[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (196 \times 3) \]
\[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
\[ = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4} \]

Step 1:
### Step 1: Understanding the Problem Setup
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the setup. We have an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with point $P$ inside it. The distances from $P$ to the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ are given as altitudes from $P$ with lengths 8, 6, and 7, respectively. Recall that these altitudes are perpendicular from $P$ to each side. We are tasked with finding the area of triangle $ABC$.
Step 2:
### Step 2: Setting Up the Altitude Relationship with Area
The sum of the areas of the smaller triangles $ABP$, $BCP$, and $CAP$ formed inside triangle $ABC$ must equal the area of $ABC$:  
- Area of $ABP$ = $\frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot 8$
- Area of $BCP$ = $\frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot 6$
- Area of $CAP$ = $\frac{1}{2} \cdot CA \cdot 7$
  
Since $ABC$ is equilateral, we set $AB = BC = CA = s$. Hence, the expressions simplify to:  
- $\frac{1}{2} s \times 8$
- $\frac{1}{2} s \times 6$
- $\frac{1}{2} s \times 7$
Step 3:
### Step 3: Calculating the Total Area from Internal Points

These three different sub-area components add up to:

- $\frac{1}{2}(8s) + \frac{1}{2}(6s) + \frac{1}{2}(7s) = 4s + 3s + 3.5s = 10.5s$

Thus, the total area of triangle $ABC$, calculated by summing the sub-triangle areas, is $10.5s$.
Step 4:
### Step 4: Equating Areas to Find Side Length
Since the total area of triangle $ABC$ must be equal to the area calculated by summing up the altitudes to each side, we use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:  
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]

Setting this equal to the expression we derived from the sum of the partitioned areas:
\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = 10.5s \]

Now, simplify and solve for $s$ (the common side length):  
\[ \sqrt{3} s^2 = 42s \]
\[ s(\sqrt{3} s - 42) = 0 \]

Since $s = 0$ is not a valid length, we solve the equation:
\[ \sqrt{3} s = 42 \]
\[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Rationalize the denominator and simplify:
\[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = 14 \sqrt{3} \]
Step 5:
### Step 5: Finding the Final Area of Triangle $ABC$
With the side length $s$ now known:
\[ s = 14 \sqrt{3} \]

We can plug this back into the area formula for the equilateral triangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
Substitute $s = 14 \sqrt{3}$:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (14 \sqrt{3})^2 \]
\[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (196 \times 3) \]
\[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 588 \]
\[ = \frac{588 \sqrt{3}}{4} \]
\[ = 147 \sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the area of triangle $ABC$ is 147√3.>>
