Verifying current step: 
**Step 2: Apply Viviani's Theorem**  
Using Viviani's Theorem, we equate the sum of the given altitudes from point $P$ to the sides of the triangle to the altitude of the entire triangle:
- \[ 8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2} \]
- Thus, \[ 21 = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2} \]
- Solving for $s$, multiply both sides by 2:
  \[ 42 = s\sqrt{3} \]
- Divide by \( \sqrt{3} \):
  \[ s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} \]
