**Step 2: Recall and apply Viviani's Theorem**
   - Viviani’s theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances to the three sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
   - Therefore, let $\Delta$ be the area of triangle $ABC$ and $s$ be the side length of the triangle. The altitude of $\triangle ABC$ can be expressed in terms of $s$ as $\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Step 1:
**Step 1: Understand the problem setup**
   - We have an equilateral triangle $ABC$ and a point $P$ inside it.
   - The altitudes from $P$ to the sides $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CA}$ are 8, 6, and 7, respectively.
   - The goal is to determine the area of triangle $ABC$.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Recall and apply Viviani's Theorem**
   - Viviani’s theorem states that for any point inside an equilateral triangle, the sum of the perpendicular distances to the three sides is equal to the altitude of the triangle.
   - Therefore, let $\Delta$ be the area of triangle $ABC$ and $s$ be the side length of the triangle. The altitude of $\triangle ABC$ can be expressed in terms of $s$ as $\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
   - Hence, by Viviani's theorem, the sum of the altitudes from point $P$ is equal to $\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}$:
     $$8 + 6 + 7 = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}.$$
Step 3:
**Step 3: Solve for the side length $s$**
   - From the equation:\
     $$21 = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}.$$  
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\
     $$42 = s\sqrt{3}.$$  
   - Divide both sides by $\sqrt{3}$ to solve for $s$:\
     $$s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}}.$$  
   - Simplify $s$ by rationalizing the denominator:\
     $$s = \frac{42 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}.$$
Step 4:
**Step 4: Calculate the altitude of triangle $ABC$**
   - Use the altitude formula for an equilateral triangle relating the side length:
     $$\text{Altitude} = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}.$$  
   - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ into the altitude equation:
     $$\text{Altitude} = \frac{14\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3}}{2}.$$
   - Simplify further:
     $$\text{Altitude} = \frac{14 \cdot 3}{2} = 21.$$
Step 5:
**Step 5: Compute the area of triangle $ABC$**
   - Use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, $\Delta = \frac{s^2\sqrt{3}}{4}$, or directly using its base and altitude:
   - Area using base (side) $s$ and altitude:
     $$\Delta = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times \text{Altitude}.$$ 
   - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ and $\text{Altitude} = 21$ into the equation:
     $$\Delta = \frac{1}{2} \times 14\sqrt{3} \times 21.$$  
   - Simplify:
     $$\Delta = 7 \times 21\sqrt{3} = 147\sqrt{3}.$$
