Step 1:
**Step 1: Understanding the Altitudes and Mass Point Geometry**
   - Place point $P$ such that it projects to points on sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$, at distances of 8, 6, and 7 respectively. 
   - Recognize that the sum of these altitudes is equal to the altitude from any side of the triangle when point $P$ coincides exactly at the centroid. Use Viviani’s theorem here.
Step 2:
**Step 2: Apply Viviani's Theorem**
   - In an equilateral triangle, Viviani’s theorem states that for an interior point $P$, the sum of perpendicular distances from $P$ to the sides of the triangle equals the length of the triangle’s altitude. 
   - Knowing that 8+6+7=21, this sum is equivalent to the triangle’s altitude.
Step 3:
**Step 3: Calculate the Altitude of the Equilateral Triangle** 
   - Use the equation $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 21$, where $s$ is the side length of the triangle and $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s$ is the altitude.
   - Solve for $s$: $s = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42 \times \sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3}$.
Step 4:
**Step 4: Determining the Area of the Triangle** 
   - The formula for the area $A$ of an equilateral triangle is $A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2$.
   - Substitute $s = 14\sqrt{3}$ to find the area:
      $A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (14\sqrt{3})^2$ 
      $A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 196 \times 3$
      $A = \frac{1}{4} \times 588 \times \sqrt{3}$
      $A = 147\sqrt{3}$.
